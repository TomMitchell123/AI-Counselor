Students on academic\nprobation and warning are eligible for continued enrollment and good standing (absent any violations of\npolicies outlined in the Hokie Handbook.\nAcademic Warning: Students earning less than a 2.00 term GPA, but with a cumulative grade point average of\n2.00 or higher, will be placed on academic warning without notation on the academic transcript. Students on\nacademic warning will be required to consult with the appropriate undergraduate assistant or associate dean\nof their college and to sign an academic contract. Failure to complete an action plan (academic contract) may\nresult in prohibition from future enrollment(s).\nAcademic probation is imposed when a student's cumulative GPA is less than 2.00; academic probation is\nlifted when their cumulative GPA is at least 2.00. Academic performance will be reviewed at the end of each\nregular semester (fall and spring).\nA student on probation:\n1. may take no more than 16 credits per semester;\n2. 2. may be required (at the discretion of individual colleges) to consult with an academic advisor regularly\nand to sign an academic contract acknowledging their performance is not meeting university standards\nand stating what actions they are committed to taking to improve academic performance.\nFirst suspension will be imposed whenever one of the following occurs:\n1. A student on academic probation has a cumulative GPA less than 2.00 for the first two semesters (fall,\nspring) of enrollment; or\n2. A student has two consecutive semesters thereafter with a cumulative GPA below 2.00.\nFirst Suspension (Fall): A student who is placed on first academic suspension at the end of fall semester will\nbe suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following spring semester. Note: Students\nplaced on first academic suspension at the end of fall semester are eligible to return the subsequent first\nsummer, second summer, or fall semester.\nFirst Suspension (Spring): A student who is placed on first academic suspension at the end of spring\nsemester will be suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following fall semester. Note:\nStudents placed on first academic suspension at the end of spring semester may NOT enroll in the\nimmediately following summer sessions.\nA student must earn a minimum 2.00 semester GPA the first semester back and raise their cumulative GPA to\nat least 2.00 by the end of the second semester back or earn a 2.50 GPA for every semester following the\nsuspension until their cumulative GPA is 2.00 or greater. A student will be placed on second academic\nsuspension for failure to meet these minimum performance requirements upon their return.\nSecond Suspension (Fall): A student who is placed on second academic suspension at the end of fall\nsemester will be suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following fall semester. Note:\nStudents placed on second academic suspension at the end of fall semester may NOT enroll in the\nimmediately following summer sessions.\nSecond Suspension (Spring): A student who is placed on second academic suspension at the end of spring\nsemester will be suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following spring semester. Note:\nStudents placed on second academic suspension at the end of spring semester may NOT enroll in the\nimmediately following summer sessions. The same minimum returning performance requirements apply for\nsecond suspension as for first suspension.\nFinal Suspension: A student will be permanently dismissed for failure to meet the minimum returning\nperformance requirements after a second academic suspension.Academic Eligibility Appeals\nStudents who are suspended due to academic eligibility at the end of fall or spring terms may appeal their\nsuspension to the University Appeals Committee. The University Appeals Committee is comprised of the\nassociate deans of undergraduate studies of the academic colleges and one faculty member appointed by the\nVice Provost for Undergraduate Academic Affairs. A representative of the Dean of Students Office participates\nas a non-voting member of the committee to provide any information and background available through their\nadvocacy services. The University Appeals Committee is an advisory committee to the Vice Provost for\nUndergraduate Academic Affairs.\nAny appeal for exceptions to the academic eligibility requirements must be based on clear extenuating\ncircumstances beyond a student's control that negatively impacted academic performance. If an appeal is\nbased on physical, psychiatric, or disability/learning disability reasons, the appeal must be reviewed by the\nHealth Evaluating Committee. A recommendation letter from the appropriate office is required to complete an\nappeal petition.\nStudents must complete an academic appeals petition and submit all required documentation to the associate\ndean of their major college by the published college deadline. Failure to meet the published deadline results in\nthe loss of opportunity to appeal for the term. Students have a right to appear in person at the appeals\nmeeting. Students may not bring an outside advocate to an appeals meeting.\nFull instructions and forms for academic appeals are available on each academic college website along with\nthe dates of the academic appeals meetings. The associate dean of the student's major college may require a\npreliminary meeting to discuss the appeal. The associate dean also may establish an independent submission\ndeadline prior to each University Appeals committee meeting.\nIf the University Appeals Committee denies an appeal, the student may request further consideration of the\nacademic appeal by the provost's representative. The decision of the provost's representative is final and there\nis no further recourse.\nAccreditation\nVirginia Tech is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to\naward doctoral, masters, baccalaureate, and associate degrees. Contact the Southern Association of Colleges\nand Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097 or call 404-679-\n4500 for questions about the accreditation of Virginia Tech.\nUSDOE\nNext\nProgram Specialized Accred.

The application for degree\ncan be found on Hokie SPA under the Degree Menu. Once students have completed the application, they\nshould generate a Degree Audit Report (DARS). The DARS report will help students to be fully aware of all\ndegree requirements, which remain to be completed. This report can also be generated through Hokie SPA.\nDouble Major(s): Undergraduate students who fulfill the requirements for two majors concurrently will receive\nrecognition of the second major (double major) by including the additional major on their application for degree\non Hokie Spa. Only the primary major will appear on the diploma. Students will receive double major\ncertificates in recognition of the second major. The additional major will be included on students' official\ntranscripts.\nSecond Undergraduate Degree: Students may earn a second bachelor's degree (and diploma) by earning a\nminimum of 30 additional credit hours in residence with a minimum 2.00 GPA on all work attempted. All\nspecific requirements must be met for each degree program, including attainment of the 2.00 GPA for all\ncourses in the major. Note: The threshold for the total number of pass/fail hours allowed may not exceed the\nmaximum for the first degree.\nTraditionally, degrees are conferred upon candidates who are present to receive them at the Commencement\nceremony in May. Candidates may have their degrees conferred in absentia if they cannot be present at\nCommencement. To arrange for this, a candidate must indicate to the University Registrar either via Hokie\nSPA or in writing to be excused from the Commencement ceremony.\nIn addition to the traditional Commencement, other \"Degree Conferral Dates\" have been established for each\nMay to May year. The degree conferral dates for fall, winter, first summer, and second summer appear on the\ndiplomas of qualified graduates. The degree conferral dates fall on the last day of final examinations (last day\nof term) for first summer session, second summer session, fall semester, and winter term. Names of\ngraduates of summer and fall terms will appear in the fall commencement ceremony program only.\nNo commencement ceremonies are conducted at the end of the summer sessions, but graduates may attend\nthe fall ceremony after completion of degree requirements. They may also request permission from thedepartment to \"walk through\" the spring commencement ceremony based on established departmental or\ncollege guidelines. Diplomas are not distributed.\nCompletion of degree requirements is determined after the final grade reports are available. Degrees are\nregarded as having been conferred on the appropriate conferral date upon determination by the University\nRegistrar that degree requirements have been met. All course enrollments and attendance obligations must\nhave been completed on or before the degree conferral date. University actions, such as Honor System or\nConduct System sanctions, may delay the awarding of a degree, the effective term of the degree and release\nof the diploma. Students with university actions will have their final degree conferral date moved in accordance\nwith the completion of sanctions. Students who are unable to complete degree requirements based on their\noriginal application for degree term are responsible for moving their date of completion.\nStudents may resolve degree completion problems up to thirty (30) days after the degree term to retain the\nconferral date on the diploma. Any resolutions of degree completion problems following the thirty day\nresolution window will be conferred on the next subsequent term following resolution of the problem(s).\nResolutions of degree problems include failure to submit appropriate paperwork to the university.\nWith the exception of spring, diplomas for all other \"Degree Conferral Dates\" are ordered after course work\ncompletions are established. Diplomas are distributed either by mail or in person to graduates who appear in\nthe Office of the University Registrar, or at the next Commencement ceremony, if available.\nAssessment of Student Learning Experiences\nA critical element in the continuous improvement of programs and services at Virginia Tech is the evaluation of\nstudent learning experiences, perceptions, and academic achievement. Each student may be asked to\nparticipate in assessment activities, including but not limited to course assignments, surveys, focus groups,\nend of course evaluations, tests, and personal interviews. Student involvement in these assessment activities\nwill assist Virginia Tech in providing current and future students with high-quality learning experiences in\nkeeping with the mission of the University.\nCombination Degrees\nThe bachelor's degree will be awarded to a student who has satisfactorily completed three years of\nundergraduate work in an appropriate curriculum and the first year of work in an accredited medical, dental,\nveterinary, or law school, or medical technology program (biology majors only), or physical therapy program\n(biology majors only), provided the student fulfills the requirements for the three-year program as follows:\nAt least two of the three years of pre-professional work, including the third year in residence, must be at\nthe university.\nA minimum of 90 semester hours undergraduate work, i.e. pre-professional school credit, must be\nearned.\nCurriculum for Liberal Education requirements must be met, plus at least 18 of the 30 hours required in\nthe major during the three-year, pre-professional work program. A department may require more than 18\nhours of course work in the major.\nDegree Programs\nVirginia Tech offers four-year degree programs leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, or\nBachelor of Fine Arts degree. Also offered are five-year Bachelor of Architecture and Bachelor of Landscape\nArchitecture programs. Virginia Tech also offers graduate work in 76 fields of study leading to masters\ndegrees and in 62 fields leading to doctoral degrees. A professional degree is offered through the Virginia-\nMaryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, located at Virginia Tech, and a medical degree from the\nVirginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.\nDirected and Independent EnrollmentVirginia Tech offers several types of courses that can be tailored to the needs of individual students or special\ngroups. By allowing students to pursue topics in which formal courses are not available, these directed and\nindependent courses provide greater flexibility in course offerings. They also provide students an opportunity\nto assume a greater share of the responsibility for their own education outside the traditional classroom\nsituation.\nIn order to enroll in a directed or independent course, students must develop a plan of work to reach particular\nobjectives, obtain approval of both the department and the faculty member who will supervise the work, and\nwork with them to arrange hours and credits.\nStudents must submit an official approval form prior to registration. In most cases, the student's first contact\nfor an independent study, field study, or undergraduate research course is the department offering the course.\nRegistration is through the student's dean's office. Special study courses are set up by the department, and\nthe student registers through web course request. Some colleges and departments have restrictions on\neligibility to register for these courses, and limit the number of hours that can be used toward graduation.\nField Study (X964) courses are work experiences approved by some departments and are selected to\naugment traditional classroom activities. The student is evaluated on the knowledge and skills acquired as a\nresult of the experience. Emphasis is placed on the academic and practical value of the work.\nIndependent Study (X974) courses generally involve extensive reading and tutorial sessions with the faculty\nsupervisor and also may involve written papers and other assessments. The subject of Independent Study\nusually is a continuation in greater depth of a topic covered in a regular course, allowing students to study\ntopics of particular individual interest.\nSpecial Study (X984) courses are designed for a group of students, rather than for a single individual. This\ntype of course may be used to study a timely topic, one in which there is current, but not necessarily lasting,\ninterest. It also may be used to launch an experimental course before incorporating it into the regular\ncurriculum.\nUndergraduate Research (X994) courses are individual research projects carried out by students under\nfaculty supervision. The student defines the research topic, proposes a methodology, carries out the research,\nand writes a report.\nGlobal Education\nVirginia Tech students have the opportunity to study abroad through various programs spanning the globe.\nStudy abroad programs touch on almost every academic discipline and provide the opportunity to develop or\nstrengthen global competency. Students can experience an academic discipline at work in an international\nsetting, improve language skills, cultivate new intellectual interests, challenge assumptions about their own\nand foreign cultures, and build intercultural networks, understanding, and communication skills of value to\nfuture employers..\nThe Steger Center for International Scholarship, located in the picturesque town of Riva San Vitale,\nSwitzerland, is Virginia Tech's study center in Europe. Housed in a 250-year-old villa, the Steger Center\nprovides classrooms, a library, an architecture studio, study and lounge areas, a cafeteria, and a garden in an\nunforgettable setting. The central location allows for excursions to other European sites that complement\nclassroom instruction. Steger Center programs offer courses in architecture, geosciences, the humanities,\nUniversity Honors, and Italian that may count toward Curriculum for Liberal Education and major\nrequirements. Students may participate in semester-long programs in the fall and spring or short-term\nprograms in the summer.\nVirginia Tech also has a growing number of study abroad opportunities in Africa. Growing more rapidly\nthan any other part of the world and representing the next great frontier for innovations in business, science,\nand technology, Africa is a critical region for the world's future. The opportunity to live and study shoulder-to-\nshoulder with Africa's youth as they rise to meet the extraordinary challenges of their future offers VT studentsa unique pathway to academic, personal, social, and professional growth.\nFaculty-led programs on every continent provide another option for international experience. Virginia Tech\nfaculty design and lead more than 70 short-term courses abroad during the winter or summer terms.\nParticipants in faculty-led programs have the ability to focus on a specific course or discipline while navigating\nthe culture along with a faculty member and fellow Hokies.\nAdditionally, through Virginia Tech's international partnerships and membership in the International Student\nExchange Program (ISEP) consortium, students can study on exchange for a semester or year at one of over\n200 universities worldwide, where they are immersed in the local classroom, culture and community. Students\nwho participate in bilateral and ISEP student exchange programs pay their regular home campus tuition\nand fees for the term of study, and tuition at the host university is waived. Semester exchanges serve all\nmajors and are available in Latin America (Central and South), Europe (including Iceland and Scandinavia),\nAfrica (North and Sub-Saharan), the Middle East, Asia (East and Southeast), and Oceania.\nSemester/academic year programs are also available through other study abroad third-party or non-Virginia\nTech providers.\nStudents should meet with an academic advisor early in the study abroad planning process to determine how\nclasses taken abroad will fit into a degree program and how credit is awarded. Students must obtain pre-\napproval for all credits to be transferred to Virginia Tech for use toward degree completion and must register\ntheir study abroad program with the Global Education Office. All non-VT credits taken abroad return as\ntransfer credit: the grade does not appear on the VT transcript and is not factored into the GPA. For course\ncredit to transfer, an equivalent grade of \"C\" or better is required and courses must be reported on an official\ntranscript either from an institution recognized by the Ministry of Education and authorized to grant degrees in\nits home country or from a US-accredited college or university. A minimum of 25% of the credits for the\ndegree must be earned at Virginia Tech.\nOf the last 45 hours before graduation, only 18 semester hours may be transferred from another\ninstitution.\nA course passed at VT takes priority over a transfer equivalent course.\nPass/Fail, extra credit, home study courses, correspondence courses, terminal or vocational courses do\nnot transfer.\nOnline courses are eligible for transfer.\nIf completing more than one degree (not a second major) only courses for the primary degree will\ntransfer.\nStudents completing more than one degree (not a second major) must complete an extra 30 hours for\ntheir second degree in residence (at Virginia Tech).\nAuthorization is denied if a student is on academic suspension while taking the course(s).\nTransfer credits do not affect GPA, but professional and graduate schools will typically review the grades\non the original transcript.\nApart from credits, students and parents considering study abroad programs typically have questions\nregarding costs. Program costs can vary largely depending on various factors including location, length, and\nprogram type. Most forms of financial aid may be applied to study abroad, and there are several scholarships\nand grants available. Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid as soon\nas they consider studying abroad.\nFor all questions regarding study abroad, students are encouraged to visit the Global Education Office website\nor visit the office to speak with an advisor.\nThe Global Education Office strives to strengthen the university's mission of global engagement, discovery,\nand service by connecting faculty and students to peers abroad; inspiring and contributing to the faculty's\ncreation and promotion of cross-cultural learning experiences; and supporting the development of Virginia\nTech students into globally competent citizens. For more information, contact the Global Education Office at\n526 Prices Fork Road, Room 131, or consult: www.globaleducation.vt.edu.Graduation Requirements and Degree Conferrals\nThe approved requirements in effect for the year/term of application for degree apply. A student must\ncomplete all courses with at least a minimum 2.00 GPA for all hours attempted. In addition, a student must\npresent an equally satisfactory record in courses attempted in the major and/or any minor. The number of\ncredit hours required varies from one major to another. Virginia Tech reserves the right to modify requirements\nin the student's program if necessary. Degree r must be approved two years prior to their effective use. The\napproved graduation requirements (referenced as graduation checksheets) appear at the University Registrar\nwebsite: https://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nAll students must earn 25% of credits required for their respective degree from Virginia Tech. No more than\nfifty (50) percent of credit hours earned from a two year institution may be used to satisfy graduation\nrequirements. Students who must enroll in foreign language courses to complete admission requirements may\nnot use the credits toward completion of the degree.\nUndergraduate students are permitted to complete a maximum of 18 of their last 45 hours in absentia and to\ntransfer to complete their graduation requirements, so long as the request to transfer these credits meets all\nthe current requirements in effect (transfer transcript is required and approval of the student's Academic\nDean). In addition, the credits to be transferred may consist of required as well as elective credits as long as\nprior approval has been obtained from the student's Academic Dean to transfer any required credits.\nUndergraduate students studying away from campus during their last 45 hours may apply for an individual\nwaiver of the requirement that a maximum of 18 of their last 45 hours may be earned in absentia. Approval of\nthe request will be at the discretion of their academic dean. This does not preclude the requirement that at\nleast 25% of all credits be earned in residence at Virginia Tech.\nGraduation with Distinction (Academic Policies Governing Enrollment Section)\nLanguage Study Requirement\nStudents must meet a language study requirement either through middle and high school enrollment or prior\nto receipt of the undergraduate degree. The minimum requirement may be met in middle or high school by\ncompleting two units of a single foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. Some majors in the\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences may require 3 units of a single foreign or classical language or\nAmerican Sign Language. Students completing the requirement at Virginia Tech may not count the hours\ntoward degree completion. The requirement also may be met after admission by one of the following:\nEarning six (6) semester hours of college-level foreign or classical language credit or American Sign\nLanguage. Such credits are in addition to that number normally required for graduation in a student's\nprogram of study.\nReceiving credit by examination for a foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. The\ncredit by examination option is available only to students who have gained knowledge of a foreign\nlanguage without the benefit of formal training. This privilege is intended to recognize informal non-\nacademic learning experience and is not offered to a student who has had regular classroom instruction\nin that foreign language. Contact the Department of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures for\nmore information.\nHonor Code and Honor System\nThe Virginia Tech Honor Code is the university policy that defines the expected standards of conduct in\nacademic affairs. The Virginia Tech honor pledge is as follows: \"As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor\nand integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.\" Further,\nstudents are prohibited from giving and/or receiving unauthorized assistance on their course work.\nEach student who enrolls at Virginia Tech is responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has\ndoubts about how the Honor Code applies to any graded assignment is responsible for obtaining specific\nguidance from the instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Students should assume that all\nprojects and homework assignments are to be completed individually unless otherwise specified by theinstructor.\nCommission of any of the following acts shall constitute academic misconduct. This listing is not, however,\nexclusive of other acts that may reasonably be said to constitute academic misconduct.\nCHEATING - The intentional use of unauthorized materials, information, notes, study aids or other\ndevices or materials in any academic exercise, or attempts thereof.\nPLAGIARISM - The copying of the language, structure, programming, computer code, ideas, and/or\nthoughts of another and passing off the same as one's own original work, or attempts thereof.\nFALSIFICATION - The statement of any untruth, either verbally or in writing, with respect to any element\nof one's academic work, or attempts thereof.\nFABRICATION - Making up data and results, and recording or reporting them, or submitting fabricated\ndocuments, or attempts thereof.\nMULTIPLE SUBMISSION - The submission for credit without authorization of the instructor receiving the\nwork of substantial portions of any work (including oral reports) previously submitted for credit at any\nacademic institution, or attempts thereof.\nCOMPLICITY - Intentionally helping another to engage in an act of academic misconduct, or attempts\nthereof.\nVIOLATION OF UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE, DEPARTMENTAL, PROGRAM, COURSE, OR FACULTY\nRULES - The violation of any University, College, Departmental, Program, or Faculty Rules relating to\nacademic matters that may lead to an unfair academic advantage by the student violating the rule(s).\nInstances of academic misconduct represent behavior that is of an especially serious nature. The University's\nnormal sanction for academic misconduct is an F* as the student's final course grade. The F* sanction is\nintended to identify a student who has failed to uphold the values of academic integrity at Virginia Tech. A\nstudent who is assessed a sanction of F* as their final course grade shall have it documented on their\ntranscript with the notation \"FAILURE DUE TO ACADEMIC HONOR CODE VIOLATION.\" More severe or\nlesser penalties may be imposed if the circumstances warrant.\nThe Honor Code fosters an environment that promotes fairness, personal responsibility, and integrity. More\ninformation about the Honor Code is available at www.honorsystem.vt.edu.\nPre-Professional Preparation\nPre-Law Advising\nLaw students and lawyers come from many undergraduate backgrounds, and the skills necessary to succeed\nin law school and as an attorney can be developed in a variety of courses across a range of disciplines. Law\nschools do not treat any specific course or major as a prerequisite for admission, nor do they look with special\nfavor on applicants who have graduated from a formal \"pre-law\" program. Accordingly, Virginia Tech does not\noffer a formal pre-law major. The university does offer a top-quality education in a large number of fields, as\nwell as counseling about law as a career, preparing for and applying to law schools, and the law school\nadmission process. Students are encouraged to maintain contact with the University pre-law advisors, the\nCareer and Professional Development office, and others on campus with information about legal careers.\nFor further information on pre-law studies at Virginia Tech, including how to contact the University pre-law\nadvisors, see the following website: http://www.prelaw.psci.vt.edu.\nRestricted Majors and Programs\nStudents should be aware that there are some academic majors and programs within the university that have\nstrict entrance requirements or are in such high demand that they cannot accommodate all who wish to enter\nthem. Administrators of these restricted programs must be selective in allowing students to transfer in from\nother majors within the university and in permitting second majors or minors. Students seeking entrance into\nsuch restricted programs should consult the appropriate department.Restricted programs for internal transfers are as follows:\nCollege of Agriculture and Life Sciences\nHuman Nutrition, Foods and Exercise\nCollege of Architecture & Urban Studies\nArchitecture\nArt (Visual Communication Design; Studio Art)\nIndustrial Design - major\nIndustrial Design - minor\nInterior Design - major\nLandscape Architecture\nPamplin College of Business\nAccounting\nBusiness Information Technology\nBusiness Minor\nFinance, Ins, & Bus Law\nHospitality and Tourism Management\nManagement\nMarketing\nCollege of Engineering\nAll Engineering Majors\nCollege of Science\nBiological Sciences\nSelecting/Changing a Major, Double Major, or Minor\nUndergraduate students must be enrolled in the major(s) in which their degree is to be awarded before their\nsenior year, or with a minimum of 30 semester hours to complete before their graduation. Students seeking a\ndouble major must be accepted into the second major by the academic department before the university can\naward the second major.\nChanges from one degree program to another (i.e., changes in major) or the addition of a second major or\nminor may sometimes imply extra course work, which can delay graduation, but changes or additions in most\ninstances require no particular qualifications on part of the student. They usually can be accomplished prior to\nthe senior year, simply by working with one's academic advisor and informing the head(s) of the department(s)\nand the dean(s) of the college(s) in question.\nA major (or second major) cannot be selected after the beginning of the senior year. (See section above on\nSelecting a Major.) Some departments establish specific deadlines for requesting change of major. Check the\ndepartment's website for specific deadlines and required application materials.\nMinors are offered by many academic departments and earned simultaneously with the degree. Minors are not\ndeclared nor earned after degree completion. Refer to the section on Graduation Requirements and Degrees\nand to the appropriate academic department in the college chapters of this catalog to review the requirements\nfor a minor.\nTwenty-five percent of the credit hours required for a student's degree must be taken at Virginia Tech.\nProcedures to Follow When Changing or Adding a Major or Minor\nStudents can request a new primary major through Hokie Spa when a change of major time begins. There are\nthree common change of major times every year, fall, spring and summer. Each respective college facilitates\ntheir own process to determine if it will accept the student into the major and will then notify them.The procedure for adding second majors or adding a minor is as follows:\n1. Request an \"Application for Change in Curriculum\" from the office of the dean of your new curriculum.\n2. Follow the instructions given on the \"Application for Change in Curriculum\" form.\nSelection of Studies\nThe regular academic year at Virginia Tech is divided into two semesters, fall and spring. Virginia Tech also\noffers two summer sessions and one winter session. Most courses of study require eight (8) terms (i.e.,\nsemesters and/or summer sessions) for completion of the bachelor's degree requirements. Completion of the\ndegree requirements for those students who enroll in the Cooperative Education Program, Bachelor of\nArchitecture Program, or Bachelor of Landscape Architecture Program requires five years.\nElective courses are chosen through consultation with the student's advisor. The dean of the college in which\na student is registered has authority in such matters as substitution of courses, dropping and adding courses\nafter deadlines, or permission to take an overload.\nStudents have the assistance of faculty guidance, introductory courses, and special counseling to help them\nchoose wisely which course of study they should take. Every effort is made to assure that all courses listed\nunder the various department of instruction will be offered. Virginia Tech reserves the right, however, to\nwithdraw any course for which an inadequate number of students enroll.\nStudent Responsibilities on Official Student Records\nStudents are responsible for keeping and being familiar with their own records and for the accuracy of these\nrecords.\nA student's failure to keep their address updated does not absolve the student of responsibility for matters that\nrequire notification by the university. Changes to a student's local address, permanent address, or\nparent/guardian address should be promptly updated by accessing Hokie SPA. Correct residence hall\naddresses are established through the Housing and Residence Life Office in 144 New Hall West. If a student\nis not sure what addresses are on file, they may check Hokie SPA for verification. Virginia Tech requires\nupdating of local address, designation of emergency contact, opt in/out of VT Alerts, and understanding of the\nHokie Handbook prior to registration.\nIt is the student's responsibility to check their current schedule of classes by accessing Hokie SPA. Errors\nmust be corrected by the established deadline stated in the Timetable of Classes. Request for course(s) will\nresult in a responsibility for payment of tuition and fees. If a student requests courses via course request or\nduring drop/add, the student is responsible for the tuition and fees assessed unless formally resigning during\nthe established university deadlines. It is the student's responsibility to complete and return the\nWithdrawal/Resignation form by established term deadlines if choosing to disenroll for a given term.\nStudents are responsible for seeing their advisors during course request to assure appropriate curricula\nplanning.\nStudent Responsibilities: Satisfactory Progress Towards\nDegree\nIt is the student's responsibility to satisfy all course requirements as established by the faculty teaching the\ncourses in which they are enrolled. It is also the student's responsibility to be aware of all major, degree,\ncollege, and graduation requirements necessary to complete their degree. Additionally, students are\nresponsible for satisfying all university, college, and departmental requirements for progress towards degree.\n(Consult \"Checksheets\" at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for major\nrequirements.)Student Success Center\nwww.studentsuccess.vt.edu\n(540) 231-5499\nThe Student Success Center supports undergraduate learning from enrollment to degree completion by\noffering programs and services that help students become effective, self-motivated learners. The department\noffers academic support, such as academic coaching, tutoring, and study skills seminars to undergraduates.\nPrograms and activities for students who are already succeeding academically, and simply want to enrich their\neducational experiences at Virginia Tech are also available. All SSC programs and services are free to\nVirginia Tech students. The main office is located on the first floor of Femoyer Hall where we also have a\nclassroom, tutoring spaces, and staff offices.\nEducator (Teacher) Preparation\nwww.soe.vt.edu\nedinfo@vt.edu\nVirginia Tech's School of Education offers programs leading to licensure in 17 fields of study. All educator\npreparation programs are at the graduate level. Students seeking a teaching or other educational license\nshould consult the School of Education Office of Academic Programs website (http://www.oap.soe.vt.edu) for\ndetails on specific programs of interest. Generally, the educator preparation programs are completed in one\ncalendar year of full-time enrollment, including student teaching.\nThe School of Education is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, and all\nprograms are approved by the Virginia Board of Education. Graduates may qualify for an educator license or\nendorsement in other states.\nUndergraduate students who anticipate applying for a master's degree in education should consult the Pre-\nEducation Advisor at https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/peap/home or peap@vt.edu or the academic advisor in\ntheir undergraduate major. Decisions about entering graduate programs in education should be made early in\nthe undergraduate years so that an appropriate major can be selected and required courses can be taken\nprior to applying for the graduate program. For certain programs, seniors with a GPA of 3.0 or better may\napply to be admitted to the Dual Student Status for their last semester to take graduate-level education\ncourses and juniors with a GPA of 3.3 or better may apply for admission in the Accelerated\nUndergraduate/Graduate Degree Program to take graduate courses during the senior year. Information about\nthese options is available on the Graduate School website (www.graduateschool.vt.edu)\nApplicants for educator preparation programs must submit passing scores on Praxis Core Academic Skills for\nEducators, or acceptable scores on the SAT or ACT prior to acceptance into the School of Education. Passing\nscores on relevant Praxis Subject Assessments, the Virginia Communication and Literacy Assessment, and\nthe Reading for Virginia Educators exam (for elementary education teachers) are required prior to receiving a\nteaching license and prior to admission for some programs. A criminal record check is required by school\ndivisions in Virginia prior to employment, and for most divisions for student teaching.\nNotable features of the educator preparation program at Virginia Tech are:\ngraduates with a commitment to learning and advocacy for all students\na faculty devoted to improving education through research, teaching, and outreach\nan emphasis on science, math, and technology within a comprehensive School of Education\ngraduates with expertise in content fields and related pedagogical knowledge and skills\ncommitted clinical supervisors in schools\nfield experiences and internships in diverse school settings\nthe latest instructional technologies\na strong demand for our graduates\nApplications for School of Education programs may be submitted on line through the Graduate Schoolwebsite: www.graduateschool.vt.edu.\nUndergraduate Courses of Study\nUndergraduate courses of study leading to bachelor's degrees at Virginia Tech are listed below.

Registration for continuing students is an eight-day period (Course Request) in the middle of each\nsemester during which currently enrolled students may request classes for the next semester. Students\nregister for summer school (if they plan to attend) beginning in December. Students register for fall\nsemester during spring semester.\na. Students should consult their completed Pathways Planner and review it with their departmental\nadvisor. Both should be aware of such considerations as the student's current GPA, the course\nload in hours and in effort required, pre- and co-requisites for courses so limited, the student's\nrelationship to the eligibility schedule, and fulfillment of Curriculum for Liberal Education\n(Pathways) requirements and those for major, minor, or cognate. If the student fails to meet with\ntheir advisor, a hold may be placed on their registration.\nb. When a schedule is designed, the student utilizes the course request module in Hokie SPA to\nenter the course requests.\nc. Prerequisite checking is enforced by some departments. The registration system will review the\nstudent's academic history to determine compliance with any prerequisites.\nd. Overloads (more than 19 hours per semester, seven each summer session, or six for winter\nsession) require permission of the student's academic dean. The student will be scheduled for the\nfirst available 19 hours (seven in summer and six in winter) requested.\ne. Every student must annually provide an up-to-date local address, an emergency contact, opt\nin/opt out of the VT Alerts system and all students must acknowledge the continuing duty to report\narrests and convictions to the University. Students are prohibited from registration until the\nrequirements are updated in the student record system.\nf. The student's current class schedule may be printed by accessing Hokie SPA; the student is\nthen responsible for verifying that they are in fact enrolled in the courses and sections they have\nbeen attending.\n2. Approximately three weeks after the close of registration week, course request results are available andmay be accessed through Hokie SPA. The web class ticket will include detailed information regarding\nsections which are full, conflicting, withdrawn, or restricted which explains why these sections were not\nadded to the student's schedule. See item number six (6) below for details about why a student's course\nselections are sometimes ignored, or why a student's schedule might be purged or held from\nregistration.\n3. Students may adjust their schedules on a space available basis using web drop/add, an electronic\nschedule adjustment program. Students should consult with their advisors before making any changes\nexcept those for convenience (usually time). 1000-level Mathematics and English courses, because of\nthe high demand, currently have restrictions on section changes. As a rule, any student who drops a\n1000-level English or Math course via Hokie SPA or department will not be allowed to force-add another\n1000-level English or Math course that term. A student should be aware that dropping below full-time\nstatus (12 semester hours) may jeopardize financial aid, campus housing, and degree completion. Some\ncourses may drop students for failing to attend the first class. Refer to the comments section of the\ncourse in the Timetable of Classes.\n4. A Force-Add form permits admission to a class over the desired enrollment threshold, but not over\nroom capacity. This request is submitted via a \"force-add\" form available in the department offering\nthe course, and requires the instructor's (or, in some departments, departmental) permission. Requests\nfor force-adds are processed by the department offering the course. Caution: The force-add\ntransaction permits enrollment in courses with conflicting times.\n5. Responsibility for Payment of Tuition and Fees: all students who initiate enrollment either by course\nrequest or by drop/add are responsible for the payment of assessed tuition and fees. Only the\nsubmission of an official withdrawal or resignation removes the student from any applicble fee\nresponsibility. Failure to attend class(es) or to submit appropriate university paperwork is not a justifiable\nreason for removal of assessed fees retroactively.\n6. Late Adds and Drops Adjustments to a student's schedule after the last date to carry out a specific\ntransaction (see Hokie SPA for deadline dates) require permission of their own academic dean. Thus, a\nBusiness major wishing to late-drop an English course requires approval from the College of Business,\nnot that of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. A late-drop request based on mental or physical illness\nrequires a recommendation from Schiffert Health Center and/or Cook Counseling Center. Faculty cannot\nadd or drop students from their rosters.\n7. Purged and Held Registrations Failure to pay tuition bills by a posted deadline (usually by the end of\nthe second week of classes) may result in the student's schedule being purged (removed from the\nsystem). A schedule may be held (made inaccessible to department staff, as well as to students using\ndrop/add, thereby precluding transactions of any type) for nonpayment of fees other than tuition (e.g.,\nparking tickets), for Honor Code or Student Conduct violations, for academic ineligibility (due to\ndepartment and/or academic suspension), or for failure to make progress toward a degree. This last hold\nis imposed by the student's dean, while all other holds are imposed by other offices. The student should\ncheck with the office imposing the hold, as only that office is authorized to remove the hold. The Office\nof the University Bursar processes all billing for tuition and fees; contact the Office of the Bursar\nif you have questions about your bill or do not receive a bill.\n\u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University\nRegistrarMenu\n2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and",

Students presenting appeals based on medical reasons must request recommendations\nfrom the Student Health Evaluation Committee. Students may appeal other academic decisions made by their\ncollege associate dean to the college dean.\nAuditing Courses\nA student may enroll as an auditor in any class other than laboratory classes and studio courses, with the\npermission of both their academic advisor and the class instructor. The lecture portion of laboratory-linked\ncourses and courses with computation periods may be designated as eligible for audit at the request of the\nacademic department head (of the course in question) and on the approval of the student's academic dean.\nAuditors may not add or drop an audit option after the last day to enter classes. Students will not be allowed\nto register for credit in any course previously audited. Students may not unofficially attend class(es).Class Level\nA student must have received credit for at least 30 hours to be classified as a sophomore, at least 60 hours to\nbe classified as a junior, and at least 90 hours to be classified as a senior.\nCourse Prerequisites (University Policy)\nMany course offering departments enforce prerequisite checking at registration. The automated system\nchecks the student's academic history and/or current enrollment for verification of compliance. Students\nwithout the required prerequisite will be prohibited from enrolling. On occasion, students are permitted to take\ncourses without having the specified prerequisites only upon obtaining the consent of the instructor. Students\nwho enroll in a course for which they clearly have not satisfied the prerequisites or equivalent or obtained the\nappropriate permission may be dropped from the course. Deliberately false statements testifying to the\nsatisfaction of prerequisites constitute a violation of the honor code. Students have the right to appeal a\ndecision about prerequisites to the head of the department offering a course. Students should recognize that\n3000 and 4000 level courses assume a certain level of academic maturity and general background regardless\nof the stated prerequisites. The course instructor can be consulted regarding the implications of this\nexpectation for a specific course.\nEnrollment (Semester Hour)\nMinimum full-time enrollment for undergraduate and associate degree students is 12 hours per semester in\nregular A-F option or P/F option. For each summer session, the minimum is 5 hours. Audit hours are not used\nin establishing minimum full-time enrollments.\nFull-time enrollment for graduate students is 9 hours or more in regular A-F option, P/F option, or\nequivalent credit. For each summer term, the minimum is 3 hours. Neither the payment of full fees nor\ncompliance with maximums established as a condition of employment or appointment is a basis for deviation\nfrom the definition above.\nGraduation with Distinction\nGraduating with distinction is an honor bestowed on those who earn a 3.4 or higher and who complete no less\nthan 60 hours at Virginia Tech. Distinction is denoted on the diploma and on the transcript. Levels of\ndistinction are:\nStudents with a cumulative GPA of 3.8 or greater are graduated Summa Cum Laude.\nStudents with a cumulative GPA of 3.6-3.7999 are graduated Magna Cum Laude.\nStudents with a cumulative GPA of 3.4-3.5999 are graduated Cum Laude.\nGrade Point Averages are not rounded in qualifying a student for distinction. In computing eligibility for\ngraduation with distinction, only undergraduate level work attempted at Virginia Tech will be used. Students\nmay not use hours earned at Virginia Tech as an associate, professional, or graduate level as part of the 60\nsemester hours required to earn distinction. The notation of distinction on the diploma and on the transcript is\nindependent of the notation of a degree in honors, if applicable. (See section on \"The Honors Program\" for\ninformation about graduating in honors.)\nLimits on Acceptable Credits for Degrees\nNot more than 6 credit hours earned from extension courses, radio courses, television courses, and intensive\ncourses (e.g. taken while in active military service, etc.) will be accepted for undergraduate degree credit.\nThirty-eight hours of advanced placement credit and/or international baccalaureate and/or Cambridge\nInternational Examination credit may be accepted towards the undergraduate degree.Readmission through University Registrar or Academic\nDean\nFormerly enrolled students who have greater than the 2.0 GPA overall may seek readmission via web course\nrequest form if they are eligible to return. Students returning from academic suspension should consult their\nacademic dean's office for readmission procedures. (These procedures vary from college to college within the\nuniversity.)\nFormerly enrolled students, not in good academic standing who stop enrollment or resign for personal\nreasons, and later complete course work at another college or university are required to submit their transfer\ntranscripts to certify good standing at all institutions.\nAcademic standing and student conduct at other institutions are considered in the deliberation for approval for\nreadmission.\nFormerly enrolled students in good academic standing who resign for personal reasons, do not continue\nenrollment at Virginia Tech, and later complete course work at another college or university are required to\nsubmit their transfer transcripts to their academic dean prior to or during their first term of re-enrollment.\nRegistration Requirements\nDemographic Information: Virginia Tech policy requires annually the collection of specific demographic data\nfor each student: emergency contact entry or emergency contact confirmation, and VT alerts Opt In or Opt\nOut action.\nLocal Mailing Address: Virginia Tech policy requires the updating of a student\u2019s local mailing address to\nreflect the local residential address while enrolled in school.\nConduct Policy: Students must annually acknowledge the Virginia Tech\u2019s Student Conduct policy on Arrests\nand Convictions. The University enacted policy requiring all students, regardless of academic level or campus,\nto report any arrests, convictions, and/or protective orders to the university.\nVT Alerts: Students must opt in or opt out of the Virginia Tech alert system annually.\nStudents will be prohibited from registration until the above information is provided.\nMissing Person Contact: Student(s) may denote a specific third party as emergency contact as primary in\ncases of missing person(s). Visit Hokie SPA, choose the Hokie Plus menu, add \u2018new emergency contact\u2019. In\nthe pull down selection for relationships, choose \u00ab Missing Persons Contact \u00bb. In the case of such an\nemergency, the university will first contact the missing person designee before any alternate emergency\ncontact(s).\nResignations\nA student may resign without academic penalty by completing an official Virginia Tech resignation form on or\nbefore the published resignation deadline for each term. The student can request this resignation form from\neither the University Registrar's Office, the University Registrar's website, or the academic Dean's Office. The\nstudent's grade report and permanent record will show that he/she was enrolled for the term and that he/she\nresigned on the specific effective date.\nA student who resigns after the stated deadline without written authorization for resignation-without-penalty by\nthe respective academic dean will receive automatic \"F\" grades in all courses in which the student is enrolled.\nThe transcript will carry the notation, \"Suspended by committee action for unauthorized resignation,\" and the\nhours for which \"F\" grades were received will be included in the cumulative GPA for both academic eligibility\nand graduation requirements.\nIn the case of authorized resignations after the deadline, grades will not be assigned, and the academic deanwill determine the student's academic status (whether or not he/she is eligible to return) based on the\nstudent's previous record.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that all students meet the following minimum criteria to be certified as making\nsatisfactory progress toward a degree.\nHave an overall grade point average at or above that specified in the academic eligibility schedule\n(determined at the end of the Spring semester).\nUpon having attempted 36 semester credits (including transfer, advanced placement, advanced\nstanding, credit by examination, and freshman rule hours), students must have passed at least 12\nsemester credits of Curriculum for Liberal Education requirements.\nUpon having attempted 72 semester credits (including transfer, advanced placement, advanced\nstanding, credit by examination, freshman rule hours), students must:\nhave passed at least 24 semester credits of Curriculum for Liberal Education requirements\nbe enrolled in a degree-granting program and\nbe certified at the close of the academic year by their department as making satisfactory progress\ntoward a degree, based upon pre-established minimum criteria from departmental checksheets.\nUpon having attempted 96 semester credits (including transfer, advanced placement, advanced\nstanding, credit by examination, and freshman rule hours), students must have an in-major grade point\naverage of 2.0 or above.\nColleges and departments may impose additional requirements. It is the student's responsibility to become\nfamiliar with the requirements of his or her college.\nTransfer Work while on Suspension\nA student may not receive credit for course work taken at another college or university during any period in\nwhich the student has been placed on suspension by Virginia Tech for academic or disciplinary reasons.\nUndergraduate taking Graduate Courses\nUndergraduate students may enroll in graduate-level course work in the senior year, provided they have an\noverall GPA of 3.0 or above and the written approval of the department head and the Graduate School. To\nenroll in graduate-level course work, the undergraduate student must apply to the Graduate School as a dual\nregistrant. Each term that a student is dually enrolled, he or she must fill out a form in the University\nRegistrar's Office to indicate which courses are being counted for undergraduate credit and which for graduate\ncredit. If graduate courses are used to satisfy undergraduate degree requirements, they cannot be used to\nsatisfy any advanced degree requirements at Virginia Tech. Students may not concurrently have dual status\nwhile enrolled in an Undergraduate Dual status.\nGraduate courses may not be taken without prior written approval from the Graduate School.\nAccelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Degree status\nHigh achieving and talented seniors may apply for Accelerated status. The minimum admission requirements\nare:\nAn advisor for the proposed accelerated program\nListing of courses for use on the plan of study\nMinimum grade point average of 3.3\nSome programs may include additional requirements\nThe Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Degree status allows students with specific qualifications to allowcertain courses to count toward both the undergraduate and graduate degree:\nNo more than twelve (12) credit hours may be used.\nAll courses must be at the 4000 level or higher.\nNo more than six (6) credit hours may be used at the 4000 level.\nA grade of B or higher must be earned in each course. No courses may be taken pass/fail.\n125 Percent Rule for In-State Tuition\nThe Code of Virginia establishes rules for eligibility for in-state tuition for all students enrolled at public\ninstitutions in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Section 23-7.4:F of the Code of Virginia further requires\nundergraduate students to maintain progress toward the degree to comply with continued eligibility for in-state\ntuition. Students with entry dates Fall 2006 and after may not exceed attempted hours that total 125% of the\nminimum credit hours needed for a specific degree program and retain in-state tuition eligibility. Students\nexceeding 125% will be assessed a surcharge for each semester of continued enrollment after exceeding the\ncredit hour threshold. For the purpose of this state law, all credits attempted (Virginia Tech and Transfer) are\nused in the calculation of the percentage.

Such prohibition against release\ngenerally does not extend to record requests from other school officials at this institution who have an\neducational need to know, state and federal education authorities, courts or accrediting organizations.\nQuestions concerning this policy may be referred to the Office of the University Registrar.\nFERPA Disclosure\nDue to the laws covering confidentiality, it is a violation of the regulations for anyone to release non-directory\ninformation (grades, course enrollment, class schedule, standing) about any student to anyone without\npermission from the student. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requires the student to\nauthorize the university prior to release of any academic record information to a third party. Completion of the\nonline form (Hokie SPA) allows the student to approve disclosure of his/her academic record information to\nparent(s) and/or guardian(s) via an assigned \"Pass Code\". University officials must request the pass code\nprior to the release of any requested information. The disclosure will remain valid until the student removes the\nauthorization.\nTax Dependent? The Commonwealth of Virginia requires Virginia's colleges and universities to release\nacademic record information to parents of tax dependent students. This requirement is allowable within the\nguidelines of FERPA. If the student is a tax dependent of his/her parent or guardian, please denote that\ninformation by checking \"YES\" in the question column, \"Are you a Tax Dependent?\" on the online FERPA\ndisclosure form (Hokie SPA). Students are informed of any release of information prior to disclosure.\nNotification of Rights Under FERPA\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their\neducation records. These rights include the following:\n1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University\nreceives a request for access. Students must submit to the Office of the University Registrar written\nrequests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The university official will make arrangements\nfor access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the\nrecords are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall\nadvise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.\n2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are\ninaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly\nidentify the part of the record they want changed, and specify what is inaccurate or misleading. If the\nUniversity decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the\nstudent of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for\namendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student\nwhen notified of the right to a hearing.\n3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's\neducation records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One\nexception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate\neducational interests or concerns of health and safety. A school official is a person employed by the\nUniversity in an administrative, supervisor, academic or research, or support staff position (such as\nhealth staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney,\nauditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Visitors; or a student serving on an official\ncommittee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in\nperforming his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to\nreview an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\n4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by\nVirginia Tech to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that\nadministers FERPA is:Family Policy Compliance Office\nU.S. Department of Education\n400 Maryland Avenue, SW\nWashington, DC 20202-5920\nhttp://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html\nStudents may also file a complaint with the University Registrar:\nRick Sparks\n250 Student Services Building\nBlacksburg, Virginia 24061-0134\n(540) 231-7951\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act indicates that students and former students should be\ngranted the opportunity to change their names on education records upon the production of evidence showing\nthat the name has changed. The following procedure applies to requests for changes to the name appearing\non a student's education record:\nComplete Request for Change in Name form in the Office of the University Registrar\nProvide a photocopy of a Social Security card that reflects the new name and a valid drivers license or\nother form of photo identification\nProvide a photocopy of a birth certificate, marriage certificate or license, divorce decree, court order, or\nnaturalization papers including certificate number, petition number, and registration number\nPlease note that all documentation used in support of this request should reflect the name for which you are\nrequesting the change.\nThe Privacy Act of 1974 (U.S. Public Law 93-579, Sect. 7) requires that the university notify students that\ndisclosure of a Social Security number is voluntary unless employed by the university or receiving federal\nfinancial aid. Pursuant to the 2003 State Code of the Commonwealth of Virginia, no student identification card\nmay display the social security number as an identifier. Effective with students entering Fall 2003 and beyond,\na generated identification number will be utilized as the default unique identifier. This generated number will\nbe nine digits in length and will begin with the number, \"9\", nine. The generated student identification is\ndefined as personally identifiable information by federal legislation, FERPA (Family Educational Rights and\nPrivacy Act) (U.S. Public Law 93-579, Sect. 7), and is prohibited from disclosure except to education officials\nwith legitimate educational interest.\nFor students who entered Virginia Tech prior to Fall 2003, the social security number was the default student\nidentification number. Effective with the entering class of Fall 2003, a nine digit generated identifier is assigned\nto each student. Use this identifier when the student identification number is requested by a university official.\nImportant note: disclosure of the social security number may be required by different university offices if\nrequired by the Code of the Commonwealth of Virginia or Federal statute.\nRequired Demographic Information\nVirginia Tech policy requires annually the collection of specific demographic data for each student: local\nmailing address, emergency contact entry or emergency contact confirmation, VT Alerts Opt In or Opt Out\naction, and review of the Virginia Tech Student Conduct Policy. Students will be prohibited from registration\nuntil the information is provided.\nMissing Person Contact\nStudent(s) may denote a specific third party as emergency contact as primary in cases of missing person(s).\nVisit Hokie SPA, choose the Hokie Plus menu, add 'new emergency contact'. In the pull down selection for\nrelationships, choose \"Missing Persons Contact\". In case of such an emergency, the University will first\ncontact the missing person designee before any alternate emergency contact(s).Menu\n2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and",

In accordance with state policy, Virginia Tech accepts credit from Advanced Placement,\nInternational Baccalaureate, and Cambridge Exam based on annual faculty and university program review.\nCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP)\nCLEP is a national program that offers students credit by computer-based examination. This allows students\nto have the opportunity to obtain recognition for achievement in specific college courses. Students should\nrequest their official CLEP exam results directly from the College Board at: www.collegeboard.com. Virginia\nTech's CLEP school code is 5859. CLEP credit can be viewed on Hokie SPA under the grades menu. A\nmaximum of 12 credit hours may be awarded.Refer to the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.vt.edu/registration-multi-brief/ap-\nib-clep-credit.html for information and to view the CLEP Credit Table. Questions about CLEP credit should\nbe directed to the Office of the University Registrar at registrar@vt.edu.\nCredit by Examination\nCredit may be allowed by special examination where exceptional command of a subject can be demonstrated\nin lieu of formal course work. This privilege is not available to a student who has previously audited or enrolled\nin the course, or has previously attempted credit by examination in the course. If credit by examination is\ndeemed appropriate, the offering department shall have full responsibility for determining the type of\nexamination to be given and what constitutes a passing grade. A maximum of 12 hours may be awarded.\nCredit established by examination may not be used to satisfy the in-residence requirements for graduation. No\ngrades or quality credits will be assigned.\nThere is a per-credit fee for the examination. The current fee is $10.00 per credit hour and is subject to\nchange at the beginning of an academic year. Only currently enrolled undergraduate students are eligible for\nspecial examinations allowing university credit. Official approval must be obtained from the head of the\ndepartment offering the course.\nCredit for ROTC Courses\nIn some majors, not all ROTC courses may be applied toward a bachelor's degree. Students should consult\ntheir approved major checksheet for specific information on which courses will count toward their degree.\nCredit Hour System\nVirginia Tech uses the credit-hour as its unit of credit in the semester calendar system. Course descriptions\nunder the departments of instruction (in the chapters on the various colleges) indicate the number of credits\nreceived per term.\nDean's List\nUndergraduate students who attempt at least 12 credit hours with all credits graded on the A-F option and\nwho earn a 3.4 GPA for either spring or fall semester will be included on the Dean's List for that term. The\nDeans' Lists are not compiled for summer sessions. Any notifications or certificates indicating inclusion on the\nDean's List for a particular term are issued by the student's academic dean.\nExaminations and Re-Examinations\nFinal examinations are held at the close of each term according to a schedule established by the university.\nAn instructor may not change the date or time of a final exam without the approval of the dean of the college.\nStudents may request permission from their college dean to reschedule a final exam if they have conflicting\nexams or if they have three final exams in 24 hours. Otherwise, permission to reschedule a final exam is\ngranted by the dean only in very unusual circumstances. Deferred final exams may be authorized only by the\nstudent's academic dean or by the Schiffert Health Services.\nRe-examination of one final exam is available only for students who are candidates for degree in the same\nterm as the final exam.\nAfter a term is over, a re-examination in one course in which the final grade earned is C- or below may be\nauthorized if the student was enrolled in the course during the final term of his or her senior year and if a\nsatisfactory re-examination in the course will qualify the student for graduation. The student must make the re-\nexamination request to the dean and must complete the exam as soon as possible after the first examination.For the student to be granted a re-examination, approval is required by the instructor, the student's department\nhead, and the student's academic dean. In determining the validity of the student's request, consideration is\ngiven to class performance and completion of assigned work. The University Registrar provides verification of\ncompliance with the requirements of this policy.\nGrade Appeal Procedure\nAs Per University policy, the assignment of a grade is the sole prerogative of the instructor of the class. It is\nincumbent on the instructor to establish the criteria for grading in the syllabus that is distributed at the\nbeginning of the term. All grades are to be based on established grading criteria and not on personal conduct\nor opinions unrelated to academic standards. An individual student may not do extra work to raise his/her\ngrade. If a student feels that a grade has been calculated incorrectly or has been assigned in a prejudiced or\ncapricious manner, the student should discuss the matter with the instructor. If discussion between the\ninstructor and the student cannot resolve the issue, the student should appeal to the department/division\nhead. In the unusual circumstance that resolution does not occur at the departmental/divisional level, the\nstudent may appeal to the college dean who will attempt to reconcile the matter by whatever mechanism\nseems most appropriate for that college and for that case. A grade appeal must be made by the student as\nsoon as possible but no later than the end of the student's subsequent term of enrollment after the grade in\nquestion has been assigned.\nGrades and Grade Points\nThe academic achievement of a student in a specific course is rated as follows:\nGrade Points A grade of \"I\" (incomplete) may be given when the requirements\nLetter Grade\nfor each hour of a course other than the final examination have not been\nA (Excellent) 4.0 completed due to illness or extenuating circumstances beyond\nA- 3.7 the student's control. The \"I\" grade is the prerogative of the\nB+ 3.3 instructor.\nTo remove an \"I\" grade, lecture course requirements must be\nB (Good) 3.0\nsatisfied during the student's first subsequent term of enrollment,\nB- 2.7\nand laboratory course requirements must be satisfied prior to the\nC+ 2.3\nend of the first term during which the course is offered and the\nC (Fair) 2.0\nstudent is enrolled. Incomplete and \"X\" grades are automatically\nC- 1.7\nconverted to \"F\" if requirements are not fully satisfied during the\nD+ 1.3\nperiod of time allowed.\nD 1.0\nAn \"NR\" grade is assigned automatically by the system when a\nD- (Barely Passing) 0.7\nstudent is enrolled for a class and no other grade is assigned by\nF (Failure) 0.0\nthe instructor. The \"NG\" is intended to be a grade distinguishable\nI (Incomplete) ---\nfrom those initially assigned by the instructor and thus to indicate\nNG (No Grade) ---\nclearly the origin of the grade.\nNR (Not Reported) --- \u201dW\u201d Grade: Courses from which a student withdraws under the\nP (Passing) --- terms of the policy, will appear on their transcript with a \"W\"\nRP (Repeated grade, but will not count in the GPA hours nor in any GPA\n---\nCourse) calculations. The \"W\" signifies that this policy was invoked and\nS (Satisfactory/credits does not reflect the rationale for its use. The reasons for use\n---\nonly) remain the student's purview.\nW (Course Grade Point Average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total\n---\nWithdrawn) number of quality credits earned by the total number of hours\nattempted at Virginia Tech, except courses passed on a\nPass/Fail basis and courses with an \"X\" (Continuing Course).\n\"NG\" grades are computed as \"F\" grades in determining GPA.\nThe GPA is unaffected by the \"I\" grade, unless or until the \"I\" isconverted to an \"F\" for failure to complete the course\nrequirements within the allotted time. All courses repeated count\nin the calculation of the grade point average unless changed to\nPass/Fail per policy.\nX (Continuing\n---\nRepeated Courses: A student may not repeat courses in order to\nCourse)\nimprove his or her grade average where a grade of \"C or higher\nhas been earned. An assigned grade of \"A-D\" for the second\noccurrence will be changed to a grade of \"P\" whenever a\ngraduation analysis (DARS report) detects a repeated course\nwith a \"C\" or better grade. Repeating a course where the course\nis \"C-\" or below, both instances of the graded course will be\ncomputed in the grade point average.\nGrades (Midterm)\nMidterm grades are produced for freshmen and transfer students whose first term of enrollment is fall\nsemester. Beginning Fall 1996, students whose first term of enrollment is summer will also receive a midterm\ngrade report during fall semester. \"Satisfactory\" is given for work earning a grade of C or better and\n\"unsatisfactory\" is given for work earning a grade of C- or below. The midterm grade is not part of the\nstudent's permanent academic record and is only intended to be an early indication of the student's progress.\nGraduation Requirements (Grade Hours Passed or\nCompleted)\nThe \"total credits\" figure on the displayed grade report is not necessarily the same as the total hours (often\nreferenced as hours passed) required for completion of the degree (not all credit hours are effective toward\ngraduation requirements). Students are responsible for verifying required hours for completion by reviewing\ntheir degree analysis (DARS) with their advisor.\nListed below are a few examples of typical situations yielding \"pass\" hours which must be subtracted to\ndetermine the total credits useful toward graduation requirements:\nTransfer and/or advanced placement credits that have been subsequently duplicated by courses at\nVirginia Tech.\nCredits earned at Virginia Tech that have been duplicated by repeating courses or taking courses ruled\nto have duplicating credit.\nTransfer credits allowed from a two-year college that are in excess of one-half of the total credit hour\nrequirement for the curriculum.\nCredits for Physical Education Service Activities courses (now listed under HNFE), which exceed a\ntotal of two, the maximum allowed toward a bachelor's degree.\nCredits for military science that exceed the total specified by the college for the student's curriculum.\nCredits on the pass/fail grading system that exceed 12 credit hours allowable exclusive of pass/fall only\ncourses.\nCredits for courses that do not count towards the degree, (e.g. UNIV 1004 College Success Strategies)..\nObsolete Academic Records\nUnder the \"Obsolete Academic Records Policy,\" former Virginia Tech students returning to the university after\nan absence of at least five years may request in writing to have their academic records evaluated by the\nappropriate academic dean. Such transcripts will be evaluated in the same manner that transfer student\ntranscripts are considered; credits will be allowed only for those courses appropriate for the degree. The\ngrades for these allowable courses will not be factored into the student's GPA, but all courses will remain partof the student's permanent record.\nPass/Fail Grading System\nA limited pass/fail (P/F) grading system is available to encourage students to enrich their academic programs\nand explore more challenging courses outside their majors, without the pressures and demands of the regular\ngrading system. The P/F grading option is available to all undergraduates who have completed a minimum of\n30 credit hours at Virginia Tech and have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above. These restrictions do not apply\nto courses that are only offered P/F. No required course or course used for the Curriculum for Liberal\nEducation may be taken on a \"P/F\" basis (unless only offered on a P/F basis).\nUnder the pass/fail system students are allowed to attempt twelve (12) credit hours in their degree program on\na pass/fail basis exclusive of courses only offered pass/fail. Students enrolled in five-year designated\nprograms (College of Architecture and Urban Studies) may attempt twelve (12) credit hours or ten percent of\nthe total hours required for the degree whichever is greater. Courses offered pass/fail only are not included in\nthe twelve total hours allowable under the pass/fail system. Additional degree programs may not be used to\nincrease the number of pass/fail credits that a student is permitted to use toward any degree. No more than\ntwo courses per term may be taken P/F, excluding physical education activity courses and required courses\noffered on a P/F basis only.\nUnder the P/F grading system, a \"P\" is granted for earning a \"D\" or better in the course; otherwise, an \"F\" is\ngiven. A \"D-\" is a failing grade under the P/F option. The \"P\" or \"F\" is recorded on the student's transcript and\ncredit is given if the course is passed. If the course is failed, the \"F\" is considered equivalent to an \"F\"\nreceived under the \"A-F\" grading system and is included in calculation of the grade point average (GPA).\nOnce credit is received for a course taken under the P/F system, the course cannot be repeated under the \"A-\nF\" grading system.\nAny course to be taken under the P/F option should be designated as such upon request for the\ncourse. The student may change grading options to P/F until the drop deadline and to A-F until the deadline\nfor resigning without penalty.\nRepeat Course Policy\nBeginning Fall 2016 students may only attempt a course three times. An \"attempt\" is when a student is\nenrolled in a course on the last day to add courses during each semester. Courses designated as repeatable\ncredit (to the limit allowed) are excluded from this policy (e.g. independent studies, internships, etc.).\nAll course repeats should be done in consultation with a student's academic advisor. Any student who enrolls\nfor a fourth attempt will be dropped from the course. If a student's extenuating circumstances prevent\nsuccessful completion of the course on a third attempt, the student may appeal (petition) to repeat the course\nagain. For more information regarding the appeals process, please refer to your academic dean's office.\nRepeating a course subsequent times may affect financial aid and eligibility for certain programs. Students\nreceiving financial aid should check with University Scholarships and Financial Aid to determine what, if any,\nfinancial aid implications there are for repeating courses. Veterans, athletes and international students may\nhave additional rules associated with course repeats. Check with the appropriate department for additional\ninformation.\nStudy Week\nStudy week refers to the last three calendar days of classes for each semester. All written work, with the\nexceptions noted below, should be assigned so that it can be graded and returned during a regularly\nscheduled class meeting of the term. In-class hour-long examinations or other major in-class written\nassignments or tests shall not be given during study week. The exceptions for undergraduate courses are:\nDates for turning in term papers and project reports may be set at the discretion of the instructor,provided that the student is not to be held responsible on the final examination for the subject matter\ntherein.\nIn laboratory courses or other courses that do not warrant a final examination during the examination\nperiod, an examination, if required by the department and/or instructor, may be given during the last\nregularly scheduled laboratory or class period.\nRegularly scheduled final examinations, when special permission has been granted by the dean of the\nappropriate college.\nGraduate courses also have specific exceptions which may differ from those for undergraduate courses.\nContact the Graduate School for details.\nTransfer Credits\nEnrolled students in good standing at Virginia Tech must receive pre-approval from their academic dean's\noffice to transfer credit to Virginia Tech. Pre-approval from the academic dean does not guarantee transfer of\nthe course if the student has duplicate credit in the approved course. Students must review their degree\nrequirements (viewing DARS) to assure credits are degree applicable. Students who have been placed on\nacademic or judicial suspension by the University are not eligible to transfer credit for terms of enrollment that\ncoincide with their suspension term(s).\nThe rules below govern the transfer of credit on a university level. Some colleges at Virginia Tech have\nadditional policies and procedures regarding transfer credit. Students are responsible for consulting with the\nacademic dean's office in the appropriate college to discuss their plans to transfer credit, and to request\ninformation on the college's specific policies and procedures regarding transfer.\nCourses for transfer must be taken at an accredited college or university.\nCourses must be college-parallel, not terminal courses in a vocational program.\nOnly courses with a \"C\" grade or better will transfer. Note: A \"C-\" will not transfer.\nCredits will not transfer for students who are classified as non-degree-seeking students.\nCourse equivalencies will be determined by the Office of the University Registrar.\nCredit hours transfer; grades do not transfer.\nNo more than 60 (sixty) semester hours may transfer from the Virginia Community College System\n(VCCS).\nOf the last 45 semester hours before graduation, a maximum of 18 semester hours may be transfer\nhours.\nMany colleges and universities will require a letter of good standing from Virginia Tech before they will\nenroll a student from another university who wishes to transfer credits back. Virginia Tech students can\nrequest this letter certifying their good standing by completing a \"Request for Certification\" form in the\nOffice of the University Registrar.\nUpon completion of the course(s) and posting of grades, students are responsible for requesting that an\nofficial transcript be sent directly to the Office of the University Registrar at Virginia Tech as soon as\npossible, but not later than two semesters after the work is completed.\n\"W\" Grade Policy\nThe policy is intended to assist undergraduate students who find themselves enrolled in undergraduate level\ncourses for which they are insufficiently prepared, or for those who initially enroll in majors that they\nsubsequently change. This policy allows currently enrolled students to designate a grading option of \"CW\" to a\ncourse. Courses with this option are not gradable but remain on the academic transcript with the letter grade\nof \"W\". A maximum of three (3) courses (regardless of credit) may be dropped beyond the normal six-week\ndrop deadline date during a student's undergraduate academic career at Virginia Tech subject to the following\nstipulations:\nStudents must formally request to apply the W Grade option to a course by the last day of classes ofeach term. The deadline appears in the deadlines listing of the online Time Table of Classes.\nCourses with the new grade mode of \"W\" will appear on the transcript with a \"W\" grade, but will not\ncount in the GPA hours nor in any GPA calculations. The \"W\" signifies that this policy was invoked and\ndoes not reflect the rationale for its use. The reasons for use remains the student's purview.\nThere are no refunds of tuition and fees as a result of application of the policy. However, utilization of\nthis grade option policy may affect Reasonable Academic Policy requirements for continued receipt of\nfederal financial aid. Students are urged to consult with their financial aid advisor.\nA student decision to invoke this policy is irrevocable and unappealable.\nApplication of the W grade option may not be employed to reduce or obviate any penalty otherwise\naccruing to students under the University Honor System. Previously processed W grade options will be\nvoided if the course is penalized per an Honor System action.\nStudents may request a W grade option change for any course, irrespective of the evaluation earned in it\nup to the point of their request for withdrawal. However, if a registration hold exists at the time of\napplication of this policy, the student must take action to remove the hold within five (5) working days of\nthe application or the request will be voided. Students are responsible for resolving their registration\nholds with the appropriate university office.\nStudents already enrolled when this policy takes effect who have exercised their option to use the\npreviously existing Freshman Rule shall not be eligible to use this policy.\nTo exercise this option, interested students should see their academic advisor to obtain a course withdrawal\nform and submit it to their designated departmental representative and academic dean for approval.\n\u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University\nRegistrarMenu\n2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and",

Current information may be obtained from the following:\nUndergraduate Admission Requirements: Director of Admissions.\nCourse Offerings: Academic departments offering the course(s) in question.\nDegree Requirements: Office of the University Registrar, head of major department, or academic\ndean of the college.\nFees and Tuition: Office of the University Bursar.\nCourse Numbering System\nThe first digit in course number designations denotes the year in which the course ordinarily is found in the\ncurricular outlines or \"checksheets,\" which are available from the major department or academic advisor. The\nsecond and third digits make the course number unique within a department. The fourth digit is 4 if the course\nis a one-term terminal course, 5 if the course is the first term in a sequence, and 6 if the second term in a\nsequence. As a general rule, courses with 0 as the first digit do not carry university credit. Agricultural\nTechnology courses, however, are an exception.\nCross Listed Courses\nCourses that are cross listed between departments may not be counted twice toward meeting graduation\nrequirements. No credit will be allowed for a course taken that duplicates subject matter in a course for which\ncredit already has been received. Cross listed courses are indicated in the title line of course descriptions; forinstance, REL 3454 is listed as follows:\n3454 (PHIL 3454): PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION\nThe first number is the Religion course number, while the number in parentheses indicates that the course is\ncross listed with Philosophy.\nGraduate Course Listings\nInformation regarding graduate courses (5000 and above) may be found in the Graduate Catalog.\nPrerequisite Notations and Requirements\nStudents are permitted to take courses without having the specified prerequisites only upon obtaining the\nconsent of the instructor. Students who enroll in a course for which they have not clearly satisfied the\nprerequisites or equivalent, or obtained the appropriate permission, may be dropped from the course.\nDeliberately false statements testifying to the satisfaction of prerequisites constitute a violation of the honor\ncode. Students have the right to appeal a decision about prerequisites to the head of the department offering\na course. Students should recognize that 3000 and 4000 level courses assume a certain level of academic\nmaturity and general background regardless of the stated prerequisites. The course instructor can be\nconsulted regarding the implications of this expectation for a specific course. Students must consult with the\ninstructor if they wish to use the Pass/Fail option in a course for which they do not have the prerequisites.\nStudents should note prerequisite and corequisite requirements as stated in the course descriptions. Courses\nin a series may be taken independently where the series of course numbers is separated by commas (e.g.,\n3135, 3136), in the catalog listing. Where the series of course numbers is connected by hyphens (e.g., 4135-\n4136), the first course is prerequisite for the next one.\nTables\nThe numbers on the right hand side of tables listed under certain departments denote the number of hours the\nclass meets each week during the term and, in parentheses, the number of credits allowed for the course. A\nlisting such as 3(3) means that the course meets three hours each week and three credits are earned.\nUniversity Course Series (UNIV)\nUniversity Course Series are courses sponsored to enhance the undergraduate academic experience. The\ncourses may not count toward degree credit. Check with your advisor or academic dean to verify degree\napplicability.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (UNIV)\n1004: COLLEGE SUCCESS STRATEGIES\nStudy and application of strategies, skills, attitudes and behaviors leading to effective academic learning in a\ncollege setting.

Current e-bills, e-bill history, and real-time current account activity\nare viewed in the e-billing system accessed through the student portal (Hokie SPA). E-bills are posted at least\nmonthly, on the 15th (if the 15th of the month occurs on a weekend, e-bills are posted on the Friday before\nthe 15th). Payment is required by due date on the statement to avoid penalties such as a late fee, registration\nhold, and cancellation of registration.\nThe initial e-bill for fall semester 2017 will be posted July 14, 2017 and will be due August 10, 2017. Charges\nfor new activity after July 14 and payments made to date will be e-billed on August 15, and again on\nSeptember 2, 2017. All charges billed between July 14 and September 2, 2017 must be paid by midnight\nSeptember 11, 2017 or classes may be dropped for non-payment.\nThe initial e-bill for spring semester 2018 will be processed in December 2017. A schedule similar to the fall e-\nbill schedule is followed. All charges for the fall and spring semesters must be paid by the close of the 10th\nclass day, one week following the last day to add classes each semester, or classes may be dropped for non-\npayment.\nE-bills for the summer and winter terms will be posted at least one month prior to the start of each term.\nPast due charges will prevent access to drop add and prevent pre-registration for the upcoming semester.\nFinance charges are incurred for past due charges from a prior semester.\nBudget Tuition Plan\nVirginia Tech's Budget Tuition Plan (BTP) offers a convenient method for planning and budgeting payment of\ntuition, fees, room, and board. The BTP can cover all or part of the semester institutional charges. This plan\nprovides the opportunity for the student to enroll and remit payments. The only cost for this service is a non-\nrefundable application fee that is due with the application each semester. Students can join the BTP online\nthrough Hokie SPA. Visit www.bursar.vt.edu for additional information and online tutorials.\nBursar\nThe Office of the University Bursar is responsible for the billing of tuition, fees, housing, dining plans and\nmany other student and related charges. Billing statements are electronically generated monthly for new\naccount activity and any previous balance. The e-bill can be viewed on the student portal Hokie SPA and\npayment can be made by e-check or by credit card. Payment can also be made by mail or in person at the\nBursar Office in 150 Student Services Building.\nStudents may authorize parents or others as payers on their e-bill account. Unless revoked by the student, the\nauthorized payer receives the e-bill notification monthly and is able to view the account and make payments\nelectronically to the student's account.\nRelease of Financial Information to a third party such as parent(s) and/or guardian(s) requires student\nauthorization under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The FERPA disclosure can be\ndone via the Hokie SPA.\nDetailed information regarding tuition and fees, payment deadlines, customer service window hours, the\nBudget Tuition Plan, electronic billing and payment processes, and much more are available on the Bursar's\nwebsite www.bursar.vt.edu.\nCollection of Past Due Receivables for Students\nAny amount owed to the university including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, room, board, loans, notesreceivable, and amounts due for goods and services provided is considered a receivable to the university. A\nreceivable becomes past due if payment is not received by the payment due date. At ninety days past due,\nthe receivable becomes delinquent.\nFor currently enrolled students, the primary collection tool is the placement of a \"HOLD\" by the Office of the\nUniversity Bursar on a student's record. This \"HOLD\" restricts certain student activities such as the ability to\nadd or drop classes, receive grade transcripts, register for future academic terms, and may also result in a\nhold on your diploma if you are a candidate for graduation. Once established, the \"HOLD\" remains in place\nuntil the debt is paid in full. When a student is no longer enrolled, the collection procedures utilized for other\n\"non-student\" receivables are implemented.\nIndividuals are responsible to pay all fees and charges owed to Virginia Tech. If the individual defaults on\npayment, has a returned check, e-check, or debit of said fees and charges, or has any delinquent amount\nowed, the individual must pay a penalty fee, interest at the highest rate allowed by law or as agreed to with\nVirginia Tech, and all reasonable administrative costs, collections fees, and attorney's fees incurred in the\ncollection of amounts due the university. Students will be notified by an email sent to their Virginia Tech email\naddress to alert them that a statement has been generated. Virginia Tech and their respective agents or\ncontractors may contact individuals regarding any amounts owed, at the current or any future number provided\nfor the cellular phone or other wireless device using automated telephone dialing equipment or artificial or pre-\nrecorded voice or text messages.\nAddresses must be kept current and can be changed by students as needed on Hokie SPA. Non-receipt of e-\nbill notification is not a valid defense for non-payment; it is the responsibility of the individual who has incurred\nthe debt to see that the debt is discharged.\nFor non-students, a dunning message is included on each month's statement alerting the customer to the next\ncollection steps that will be taken. If payment is not forthcoming within the stated period, the account and all\npertinent information are forwarded to an outside collection agency for further collection efforts. In addition, the\naccount is reported to national credit bureaus, thus affecting the debtor's credit rating.\nIn addition to the above measures, the university also lists the account with the Virginia Department of\nTaxation for set-off debt collection procedures. This means that any state income tax refund or payment\nprocessed through the State Treasurer's Office to the debtor will be reduced by the amount of the receivable\nowed by the debtor.\nOffice of the University Bursar (0143)\nStudent Services Building, Suite 150, Virginia Tech\n800 Washington Street SW\nBlacksburg, VA 24061\n540/231-6277\nFax: 540/231-3238\nE-mail: bursar@vt.edu\nWeb: http://www.bursar.vt.edu\nEligibility for In-State Tuition\nEligibility for in-state tuition privileges and reduced rate tuition eligibility is governed by \u00a723.1-500 through\n23.1-510 of the Code of Virginia.

To this end, the Honors College provides\nopportunities and challenges founded on meaningful and sustained relationships with faculty, independent\nlearning, undergraduate research, place-based and problem-focused experiences, and intellectual\nengagement in global contexts. Our requirements are designed to maximize the disciplinary depth,\ntransdisciplinary capabilities, and purpose-driven engagement that are the hallmarks of the VT-Shaped\nstudent experience.\nAdmissions\nThe freshman and transfer applications to Virginia Tech automatically include consideration for admission to\nthe Honors College and consideration for any relevant Honors College recruitment scholarships. The Honors\nCollege does not consider minimum test scores. We look holistically at an applicant's experiences and\nconsider the quality of engagement over sheer quantity, self-awareness and reflection on involvement, and\nauthenticity. Transfer students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.60 or better at their previous institution.\nCurrently enrolled Virginia Tech students will receive an invitation to apply to the Honors College at the end of\neach fall or spring semester provided they have achieved a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA and have at least\nfour (4) semesters remaining at Virginia Tech before they graduate.\nHonors Laureate Diploma\nVirginia Tech Honors College students work toward an Honors Laureate Diploma. This diploma offers two\noptions: the first is self-directed by the student, the second maintains that flexibility, but focuses the honors\ncredit options around a particular curricular area established in advance by the Honors College in collaboration\nwith disciplinary departments.\nThe Four Elements of an Honors Education are the foundation of an Honors Laureate Diploma. The Elements\nare Honors College Curriculum, Disciplinary Depth, Transdisciplinary Capabilities, and Undergraduate\nResearch & Guided Experiential Learning. Students are required to earn at least six honors credits in\nelements two, three, and four. Upon graduation, students are required to complete no less than thirty total\ncredits in the four elements. Visit our website at http://www.honorscollege.vt.edu for more information.An honors diploma appears on the Virginia Tech diploma as a special designation and is not a separate\ndocument.\nHonors Academic Requirements\nThe Course of Study Planner & GPA\nThe Course of Study Planner (COSP)\nTo demonstrate potential to earn an Honors Laureate Diploma, the Honors College expects that\nstudents receive approval on their COSP by the end of their first semester in Honors.\nGPA\nTo demonstrate that students can meet the level of academic achievement we expect in Honors,\nstudents are required to achieve a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA after two traditional semesters in\nHonors. A 3.6 or better cumulative GPA from the semester at Virginia Tech immediately previous to\nentering the Honors College may count toward this requirement.\nGPA Flex Period\nOnce students accomplish the above goals, they may enter the GPA Flex Period. The GPA Flex Period\nis a time in which the Honors College no longer monitors GPA. This gives students the freedom to take\nacademic risks that can become some of their most educational experiences.\nGraduation Requirement\nStudents in the GPA Flex Period must achieve a cumulative 3.30 or better GPA and complete honors\ndiploma requirements. (Students who never receive COSP approval and never enter the GPA Flex\nPeriod are required to maintain a 3.60 cumulative GPA after every semester until the planner is\napproved or upon graduation.)\nHonors Diploma Progress\nComplete at least thirty honors credits. Elements Two, Three, and Four each require at least six honors\ncredits. Earn honors credit at least once every twelve months and complete the yearly Progress Survey.\nGrading Scale\nTake courses as A\u2013F unless P/F is the only option.\nHonors Advising\nA primary function of the Honors College is to support student efforts to individualize their education through a\nself-designed honors diploma that complements their departmental degree(s). Students can find support in the\nHonors Peer Advising Center and with the honors staff.\nThe Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors Peer\nAdvisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors Peer\nAdvising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students.\nThe Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors Peer\nAdvisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors Peer\nAdvising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students.\nThe honors staff also welcomes student appointments and walk-in visits. Each staff member has a distinct\nspecialization with which they can assist students.\nFurthermore, advising for major national scholarships, such as Rhodes and Marshall, is available through the\nHonors College for all Virginia Tech students.Honors Residential Communities\nHonors College students have two Honors residential community options: the Hillcrest Community of about\n100 students in Hillcrest Hall and the Honors Residential Commons of about 320 students in East Ambler\nJohnston Hall. Both communities are multigenerational and multidisciplinary, housing first-year students to\nfifth-year seniors from all seven colleges at Virginia Tech.\nHonors students are not required to live in an Honors residential community. Many students live off-campus or\nin other living-learning communities or residence halls.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (UH)\n1004: TOPICS FIRST-YEAR HONORS SEM\nA course for first-year University Honors students that is facilitated by students and faculty.

Sano-\nFranchini\nPhone: 540-231-8440University Academic Advising Center\nThe University Academic Advising Center serves the university community in several ways. First, it\nadministers the University Studies and Explore Technology programs for new undergraduate students\nwho want to explore a variety of degree programs before they commit to one particular major. Students\nwho enter Virginia Tech as University Studies or Explore Technology are not limited to pursuing a specific\nmajor in their first year. With the guidance of a professional academic advisor, students research the full\nrange of degree programs related to their interests and design programs of study that meet graduation\nrequirements while providing the academic flexibility to pursue whichever degree program they ultimately\nchoose. Second, the Advising Center assists new students who intend to reapply to competitive\nadmission majors. Advisors work with these students in developing programs of study that meet the\nestablished criteria for admission into their chosen major. For both of these student populations, the\nUniversity Academic Advising Center serves as both the college and department, providing administrative\nservices, dean's office services, and academic advising until the students enter a specific major.\nUniversity Studies\nUniversity Studies is a major but it is not a degree-granting program. University Studies offers a\nstructured advising program that provides students with the necessary support and strategies to\ninvestigate and compare academic disciplines so that they can make informed decisions about the\ndegree programs they will pursue. Students can explore any major available at the university while\ncompleting course requirements toward a baccalaureate degree. To ensure that students graduate in a\ntimely manner, University Studies requires all students to enter a specific degree program by the time\nthey have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) or have\nattempted 72 hours.\nExplore Technology (XT)\nXT is a major but it is not a degree granting program. XT allows students to explore majors that are\nrelated to technology and adds technological skills to other existing majors. All students in XT will take the\nExploring Technology Pathways to Success course. This course will allow you to explore different majors\nthat fit your skills and interests while preparing you for success at Virginia Tech. The course is part of theFirst Year Experience program and, best of all, will be taught by your academic advisor. To ensure that\nstudents graduate in a timely manner, XT requires all students to enter a specific degree program by the\ntime they have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) or\nhave attempted 72 hours.\nRestricted Majors\nUniversity Studies and Explore Technology students can pursue any major offered at the university;\nhowever, students should be aware that some majors are competitive for internal transfer. These\nprograms have established specific criteria and application procedures that students must fulfill in order to\nbe considered for internal transfer into the major. In general, these criteria require students to\ndemonstrate proficiency in designated core courses and, for some programs, in introductory major\ncourses before they are eligible to apply. University Studies and Explore Technology students enter and\ngraduate from these restricted programs each year; however, since there is no guarantee of acceptance\nto these programs, students are encouraged to investigate alternative majors even as they prepare to\nenter a restricted program.\nRestricted Programs for Internal Transfers\nCollege of Agriculture and Life Sciences\nHuman Nutrition, Foods and Exercise\nCollege of Architecture and Urban Studies\nArchitecture\nArt and Art History - Visual Communication (Graphic) Design; Studio Art\nCreative Technologies\nIndustrial Design\nInterior Design\nLandscape Architecture\nMinor: Industrial Design\nPamplin College of Business\nAccounting and Information Systems\nBusiness Information Technology\nFinance, Ins. & Business Law\nHospitality and Tourism Management\nManagement\nMarketing\nMinor: Business\nCollege of Engineering\nAll majors\nAcademic advisors in the University Academic Advising Center are familiar with the internal transfer\ncriteria and procedures for all restricted programs and will assist students in fulfilling these requirements.\nPathways to General Education\nAll undergraduate students at the university, regardless of their majors, are required to fulfill general\neducation course requirements in English, mathematics, science, social science, humanities, etc. There is\na standard set of these courses, Pathways to General Education, which all degree programs incorporate\nin their graduation requirements.\nIn general, General Education requirements are completed in the freshman and sophomore years. Some\nmajors are flexible with regard to which General Education courses can be used to fulfill degreerequirements; other majors designate specific General Education course selections. Academic advisors\nassist University Studies and Explore Technology students in selecting courses that apply toward as\nmany of the majors a student is considering as possible. Thus, students fulfill degree requirements for\ngraduation while they are exploring majors and are usually able to graduate on time.\nTypical First Year Program\nFirst Semester Second Semester\nFirst-Year Writing First-Year Writing\nMathematics Mathematics\nNatural Science (lab-if required by Natural Science (lab-if required by\nintended major) intended major)\nSocial Science Social Science\nHumanities/Elective/Major Specific\nHumanities/Elective\nCourse\nFor University Studies and Explore Technology students, as for most students at the university, the first\nyear is primarily devoted to fulfilling Pathways to General Education requirements. Of course, University\nStudies and Explore Technology students' programs of study vary depending upon the major or majors\nthey are considering. Specific course selections are determined in individual consultation with an\nacademic advisor.\nGraduation Requirements\nThe requirements to graduate in a specific major are determined by the department and college\nconferring the degree. In general, students are required to have a minimum 2.0 overall grade-point\naverage and a minimum 2.0 grade-point average in their major in order to graduate. The number of credit\nhours required for a baccalaureate degree varies from 120 to 136 hours, depending upon a student's\nmajor and degree program.\nHonors College\nThe freshman application to Virginia Tech automatically includes consideration for admission to the\nHonors College and consideration for any relevant Honors College recruitment scholarships.\nThe Honors College does not consider minimum test scores. They look holistically at an applicant's\nexperiences and consider the quality of engagement over sheer quantity, se;f-awareness and reflection\non involvement, and authenticity.\nA student's application to Virginia Tech automatically serves as an application to the Honors College.\nThere is no separate deadline to be considered for the Honors College.\nDean's List\nUniversity Academic Advising Center students who demonstrate academic excellence are named to the\nAcademic Dean's List and are awarded a Dean's List certificate. Students must be enrolled in a minimum\nof 12 graded hours (A-F) and must achieve a 3.4 GPA or higher in the fall or spring term to qualify.\nPre-Professional Advising\nStudents who want to enter professional schools but who have not yet chosen an undergraduate major\nwill find that the university offers a variety of degree programs that provide excellent preparation for\nadvanced training in professional fields. Though some professional programs, such as medicine, dentistry,and veterinary medicine, require students to complete a minimum number of credit hours at the\nundergraduate level in chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc., professional schools do not dictate that\nstudents pursue specific undergraduate majors. A student can pursue almost any undergraduate degree\nand be competitive for admission to a professional program.\nGlobal Education Office (Study Abroad)\nOpportunities to study at institutions in other countries are available to all qualified students, regardless of\ntheir major. Study abroad offers students a unique opportunity to learn about other cultures and peoples\nwhile earning college credit. Students who intend to participate in an overseas study experience should\ndiscuss their intentions with their advisor early in their academic career.\n\u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University RegistrarMenu\n2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and",

Vemulapalli\nWeb: www.vetmed.vt.edu\nOverview\nFounded by the Virginia General Assembly in 1978, the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary\nMedicine is a regional school for the professional training of veterinarians which has been built upon the\nstrong foundations of two of the nation's leading land-grant universities: Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and\nthe University of Maryland at College Park. The College operates three campuses, including the main\ncampus facilities at Virginia Tech, the Avrum Gudelsky Veterinary Center at College Park, and the Marion\nduPont Scott Equine Medical Center in Leesburg.Graduate Programs\nThe graduate program leads to the M.S. and Ph.D. in biomedical and veterinary sciences. The goal of\nthis program is to enhance the research capabilities of the graduates so that they can conduct\nindependent research and associated societal endeavors aimed at solving biomedical problems related to\nveterinary medicine. These individuals will be expected to make scientific contributions in academia,\nresearch, and animal health administration.\nFor additional information, contact the Graduate School via e-mail at vmsgrad@vt.edu.\nProfessional Program\nStudents desiring admission to the four-year instructional program leading to the D.V.M. degree must\nshow evidence of intellectual ability and achievement, as well as personal preparation for the curriculum\nand the profession. Because the number of applicants greatly exceeds the number of spaces in entering\nclasses, only those who demonstrate such qualifications to a high degree will be selected. Most entering\nstudents will have completed three or more years at an accredited university by the time of matriculation;\nhowever, applications will be accepted from students who have completed at least 60 semester hours or\n90 quarter hours of university credit by the end of the spring term of the year for which application is\nbeing made, and who have a grade point average of at least 2.8 on a four-point scale. Exceptional\nstudents with the minimum university course work are encouraged to apply.\nA number of college courses, with laboratory classes, are required for entry into the DVM program\nincluding biological sciences, organic chemistry, and physics. An 8-semester-hour or 12-quarter-hour\nsequence is required for each of these subjects. A one-semester course (3 semester hours) in\nbiochemistry will meet the minimum requirement for entry.\nFurther courses required include 6 semester hours or 9 quarter hours of college-level courses in English,\nmathematics, and humanities/social sciences. In addition, many courses contributing to a well-rounded\nliberal education are of direct value and, although proficiency in the sciences is essential to the\nunderstanding of veterinary medicine, concentration on the sciences at the undergraduate level is not\nessential. Those students who elect to major in disciplines other than the biological sciences, chemistry,\nor physics may find less difficulty in coping with the basic sciences in veterinary medical school if they\nhave, in addition to the above mentioned required courses, some work in either advanced biology or\nadvanced chemistry. Suggested electives include: medical terminology, biostatistics; cell biology,\ncomparative anatomy, genetics, microbiology, nutrition, physiology, or domestic animal production\ncourses. Since veterinary medicine also is concerned with a variety of social, environmental, and\ncommunity activities, a broad cultural background is important. Basic computer skills are highly desirable.\nAdmissions inquiries should be directed to:\nJacque Pelzer, D.V.M.\nDirector of Admissions and Student Services\nMs. Shelby Jenkins\nAdmissions Coordinator\nAdmissions Office\nVirginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine\nVirginia Tech\nBlacksburg, VA 24061\nPhone: (540) 231-4699\nE-mail: dvadmit@vt.edu\nWeb: www.vetmed.vt.edu\nPublic Health ProgramVirginia Tech's Public Health Program in the Department of Population Health Sciences is administered\nby the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine in partnership with the Virginia Tech Carilion\nSchool of Medicine and is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health.\nThe Master of Public Health professional degree program integrates and expands public health offerings\nat Virginia Tech and enhances the university's track record of addressing vital public health issues\nthrough learning, discovery, and engagement.\nThe program is grounded in an interdisciplinary \"One Health\" approach. One Health recognizes the\ndynamic interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health and encompasses the\ninterdisciplinary efforts of medical, veterinary, environmental health, and public health professionals to\nprotect, promote, and improve health. Students gain the requisite knowledge and skills to examine the\nhuman, animal, and environmental factors that contribute to the control and prevention of disease and the\npromotion, enhancement, and maintenance of health.\nFor additional information, please contact the Public Health Program at phs@vt.edu or by phone at (540)\n231-3945.\nProfessional Program Courses\nProfessional program courses leading to the D.V.M. degree carry the veterinary medicine (VM) prefix.

Faculty members in the department have\nchosen to specialize in selected areas of accounting or information systems and they teach and conduct\nresearch in these areas. All faculty members at the professorial ranks have Ph.D.s in accounting or\ninformation systems appropriate to the courses they teach, and many have professional certification in\ntheir areas of specialization. This faculty is committed to the education of accounting and information\nsystems professionals who will be active participants in this information age, with increasing demand for\ndata analytics skills.\nThe department's undergraduate program offers two options: Accounting (ACCT) and Information\nSystems Audit (ISA). These options are designed to allow students to specialize in their area of interest.Completion of the selected option prepares the student for entry level positions as professional\naccountants or information systems professionals who work in professional service firms, industrial\ncompanies, governmental entities, or to continue their education in graduate school. The job titles vary\ngreatly and include auditor, information systems auditor, management accountant, tax preparer, systems\nconsultant, systems analyst, controller, financial data analytics specialist, and cost analyst. The demand\nfor our graduates has been strong throughout the department's history, and that demand is continuing.\nMany graduates of our department desire to gain certification in their selected area of specialization. The\nCertified Public Accountant (CPA) is the best known of these certifications. Students taking the CPA\nexam in Virginia have to meet a 120-hour baccalaureate or higher degree requirement in order to sit for\nthe CPA exam, but must have 150 credit hours to be certified. The requirements for other states vary;\nhowever, most require students to meet the 150-hour educational requirement to be licensed. Students\nshould discuss with their advisor the several options Virginia Tech provides for meeting this requirement\nat both the undergraduate and graduate level. In addition to the CPA exam, graduates of our programs\nsit for the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) exam, the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) exam,\nthe Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) exam, and others. Students planning to take one of\nthese exams are advised to talk to their department's faculty during their junior year so that they may\nselect the electives appropriate for the selected exam.\nThe department encourages its students to gain \"real world\" experience prior to graduation through an\ninternship or by participating in the Cooperative Education Program. More information about these\nprograms is available either from the department's faculty or Career Services. The department supports\nwinter internships for seniors who enroll in the 152-hour program.\nThe department also encourages interaction with accounting and information systems professionals\nby sponsoring three student organizations: Accounting Society; National Association of Black\nAccountants; and Beta Alpha Psi, the national honorary and professional society dedicated to the\nadvancement of the accounting profession. These organizations and other campus groups provide\nmultiple opportunities for developing leadership skills and interacting with accounting and information\nsystems professionals.\nThe department encourages students to gain a global perspective of business through modules on\ninternational issues in our courses, by participation in the college's International Business Minor and/or by\nparticipating in one or more of the college's study abroad programs. Our goal is to encourage our\nstudents to become well-rounded professionals who will become leaders in their chosen careers.\nLastly, many of the department's over 7,000 alumni have generously contributed to a variety of\nscholarships for accounting and information systems majors. Each year the department awards over\n$300,000 in scholarships to our students.\nCourse Requirements\nStudents graduating from the Department of Accounting and Information Systems must have a minimum\nquality credit average (GPA) of 2.00 in upper-division (3000 and 4000 level) accounting and information\nsystems courses (the in-major GPA) as well as an overall GPA of 2.00 for all courses taken at Virginia\nTech.\nDuring their sophomore year, students must select one of the two options in the department: Accounting\n(ACCT) and Information Systems Audit (ISA).

Tarazaga, L.\nWatson, and M. Weaver\nWeb: www.aoe.vt.edu\nE-mail: aoe@vt.eduOverview\nThe Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering offers two Bachelor of Science degree programs.\nStudents in the department may major in either aerospace engineering or ocean engineering. Many of\nthe course requirements for these degrees are common, because the two curricula share a broad range\nof common interests. Both programs offer a wide range of technical electives. Students with an interest in\nboth majors may enroll in a double major program.\nThe objectives of both of the department's programs include the preparation of students for entry-level\npositions and graduate study in the fields of aerospace engineering and ocean engineering. The\ndepartment seeks to provide students with a strong background in fundamentals, including theoretical,\nexperimental, and computational aspects of science and engineering, which will facilitate lifelong learning\nand the ability to pursue advanced study. It also seeks to provide students with a broad education in the\naerospace and ocean vehicle fields encompassing fluid dynamics, vehicle dynamics and control,\npropulsion, and structures, and including an emphasis on design and synthesis in a team environment.\nThe department's curricula are vehicle oriented, with an emphasis on aircraft and spacecraft in the\naerospace program and on ships of all types in the ocean engineering program. The department's\nsystems engineering approach to these technologies makes them increasingly applicable to other fields,\nsuch as the automobile industry, high-speed train design, and other transportation related areas.\nDepartmental graduates find positions in these fields, as well as with the aerospace industry, NASA, the\nDepartment of Defense, the ship building industry, and maritime agencies. Employers range from large,\nmultinational corporations to small consulting firms.\nClassroom studies employ modern computational techniques. Laboratory classes use the department's\noutstanding experimental facilities which include a large, research-quality subsonic wind tunnel with a\ntwenty-four-foot-long, six-by-six foot cross section test area and state of the art automated control and\ndata collection systems, a 100-foot-long towing tank, a Mach 4 supersonic wind tunnel, a Mach 7\nhypersonic wind tunnel, a water tunnel, a 300-foot long asphalt runway, and several other facilities.\nThe department encourages students to seek internships and to participate in the Cooperative Education\nProgram, which gives qualified students valuable industrial experience while working toward their\nengineering degrees. The department's required design courses often include multidisciplinary projects.\nThe Aerospace Engineering and Ocean Engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. The department also offers programs of study\nleading to M. Engr., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees.\nAOE students must meet all General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) requirements and only\ncertain \"free\" electives and courses designated as \"P/F Only\" may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Lists ofapproved electives including technical, math, Liberal Education, and other electives are available on the\ndepartment's web page: www.aoe.vt.edu/undergrad/undergrad-advising/index-undergrad-\nadvising.html.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (AOE)\n2024: THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES\nBasic structural elements of stringer-stiffened thin-walled structures, forces, moments, stresses, and\ndeformation of segmented bars/beams, flexure stress and deflection of beams principal plane, plane of\nbending and plane of loading for beams with asymmetric cross sections, stresses, and twist due to\ntorsion, shear flow and shear center in open and closed stiffened thin-walled structures, stiffened multicell\nbeams, materials properties and selection.

Braaten\nWeb: www.archdesign.vt.eduOverview\nArchitecture enriches our lives by offering us environments that are sensibly compelling, thought\nprovoking, and capable of lifting our spirits. In addition to being beautiful, architecture is, by ancient\ndefinition, functional and durable. Like art, architecture is permeated by dualities. It is stable and\ntransitory, measurable and immeasurable, and capable of both being touched and touching us. Like\nscience, architecture involves systematic study. Its methods are iterative, experimental, and rely on\nintense observation. By intertwining the poetic and practical, architecture is uniquely poised to address\nthe challenges of contemporary life and build the culture of the 21st century.\nThe professional curriculum in architecture requires five years of study for the first professional degree,\nthe Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch.).\nThe first professional degree programs at Virginia Tech, the five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree (B.\nArch.), the Master of Architecture II (M.Arch.2), and the Master of Architecture III (M.Arch.3) degrees, are\nfully accredited for the current maximum six-year term of accreditation by the National Architectural\nAccrediting Board.\nAll students in the School of Architecture + Design - Architecture, Industrial Design, Interior Design and\nLandscape Architecture - begin their studies in a common first year foundation program. Following the\nfoundation program, students pursue professional studies in the 2-3 and 4-5 programs.\nFoundation Design Program - First Year\nFoundation Design Lab is an immersive, interactive learning environment focused on inquiry,\nexperimentation, discovery, and synthesis for students studying architecture, landscape architecture,\ninterior design, and industrial design. The design lab develops self-reliance and self-critique, opens\nintellectual horizons, and challenges students to continually expand and deepen their aesthetic judgment\nand critical understanding. Studies are undertaken in two and three dimensions across multiple scales.\nProfessional Program - Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth\nYears\nThe Professional Program employs design theory and processes to study the design of buildings.\nStudents conduct an interactive investigation of architectural space, environmental forces, and building\ntechnology. Foundations of discipline-specific knowledge are progressively introduced, discussed, and\nexamined as they contribute to the complex totality of a work of architecture. Students explore natural and\ncultural forces as they relate to architecture through means of representation specific to the discipline.\nWith architecture at the core, the program examines interdisciplinary sources such as art, science, and\nphilosophy for the purpose of establishing the content the discipline shares with other forms of knowledge.\nConcepts in the Professional Program are communicated through both traditional drawings and models,\nas well as through modern virtual tools and digital production. All coursework seeks to develop the ability\nto conduct a professional written and verbal discourse. Further emphasis is placed on intellectual\ndiscipline, constructive dialogue, assertion of interest, and a self-motivated search for critical issues.\nThe second year is characterized by an increase in the complexity of design exercises to foster a better\nunderstanding of the interplay between situation, time and desired spatial definition. Architectural\nconstructs of smaller scales build on knowledge of basic design principles studied in the first year. The\nlaboratory discourse focuses on principal elements of architecture and their compositional and material\nrole in space. Architecture as the art of building is conveyed through the detailed study of exemplary built\nworks.The third year provides for study of fundamental design principles, technical concepts and their\napplications, including measures of quality in architecture. The instructional content of this year articulates\nand communicates to students the unique nature of architecture through the study of interrelationships of\nmaterial, construction systems, site, and building programs. The Architecture III design laboratory guides\nthe student's growing experience with practical design problems and provides order to the gradual\nexploration and learning of the nature and means of achieving architecture. Associated with Architecture\nIll are lectures, presentations, and workshops intended to challenge students toward sensible integration\nof necessary systems and legal responsibilities in the design and construction of buildings.\nThe fourth year builds on the increased comprehension of building systems acquired during the third\nyear. On-campus or off-campus, the aim of the various program options is to promote an in-depth\nunderstanding of the relationship between architectural idea and physical building form. On-campus\nstudents are offered studio courses with various focus topics. Off-campus options include several VT and\nnon-VT Study Abroad Programs, the Extern Program, the Washington-Alexandria Center, or the Chicago\nStudio.\nOff-campus programs directed by the Virginia Tech School of Architecture + Design include:\nThe Europe Study Abroad Fall Travel Program studies seminal European historic and contemporary\narchitectural works and urban spaces, which are visited and documented with analytical drawings,\nsketches, and photographs, supplemented by on-site lectures by architects and professionals.\nDocumented research before and after the program leads students to greater depth of\nunderstanding of the issues surrounding the architecture.\nThe Steger Center Residency Program: Each semester, 16 architecture students take part in this\nprogram at Virginia Tech's European Steger Center for International Scholarship in Riva San Vitale,\nSwitzerland. An 18th century villa and its gardens on the southern tip of Lake Lugano provide\nresidence and dining facilities for Architecture + Design students, as well as 30 Virginia Tech\nstudents from other academic disciplines. Studio work, courses, research, and travel are directed to\nadvance first-hand knowledge of the architecture, geography, and culture of Europe.\nThe Chicago Studio: Hosted by significant architecture firms in downtown Chicago, this 4th-year off-\ncampus semester seeks to integrate education and practice in a direct way. Its distinctive structure\nand curriculum is centered around urban focused studio and course work, with direct input from the\nprofession. Site visits in the Chicago metropolitan area and the lectures and events of the active\narchitecture culture of Chicago contribute significantly to this program.\nProfessional Extern Program allows students to spend one semester in an approved professional\nsetting and receive up to 12 hours of academic credit. This program provides a valuable link\nbetween the academic environment and architectural practices, discipline-related government\nagencies, and other design offices throughout the world.\nThe Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center affords students from the School of Architecture +\nDesign and from related College disciplines the opportunity to study with students and faculty from a\nnational and international consortium of schools in the historic urban context of Old Town\nAlexandria. The Center complex offers studio space, classrooms, exhibition and review spaces,\nshops, and computer labs for the students and faculty of the consortium. The University also offers\na limited number of apartments for students studying at the Center.\nIn the fifth year, students conduct a yearlong advanced study with individual faculty advisors. The in-\ndepth engagement with research, theory, and design is intended to broaden a student's expertise in a\nparticular area within the field of architecture. Fifth-year students are expected to formulate and\naccomplish advanced high-level work in the form of a terminal project. Working with their advisors,\nstudents develop and discuss their research and design progress, and have periodic formal peer reviews\nthroughout the year. Students are required to leave the project documentation of their 5th-year work with\nthe school upon graduation.\nThe first professional degree programs (B.Arch., M.Arch.2 & M.Arch.3) in architecture are accredited bythe National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).\nIn the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited\nprofessional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting\nBoard (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs\nin architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of\nArchitecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year\nterm of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational\nstandards.\nDoctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-\nprofessional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned\nsequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree\nis not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.\nNext accreditation visit for all programs: 2018\nThe four-year, pre-professional degree is not offered at Virginia Tech.\nProgram Requirements\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nGraduation Requirements\nUpon successful completion of program requirements of the foundation level of study and the professional\nlevels of study in architecture and with completion of 160 credit hours of study, a first professional degree\nof Bachelor of Architecture is awarded.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet\nminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\")\nand toward the degree in Urban Affairs and Planning.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the degree can be found on the major checksheet by visiting\nthe University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (ARCH)\n1014: INTRODUCTION TO ARCHITECTURE: LESSONS IN FORM & CULTURE\nIntroduction to the discipline of architecture for non-architecture majors.

Burton, and J. W. Drinkard\nRecruiting Officer: C.A. Cox (231-8021)\nAdministrative Assistant: Connie Moses (231-6404)\nWeb: www.af.vt.edu\nOverview\nThe Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) provides a program of leadership development\nwhich prepares college men and women for service as commissioned officers in the United States Air\nForce. After graduation, they assume active duty positions in both flying and non-flying specialties. To\naccomplish this, the Department of Aerospace Studies recruits, selects, retains, and commissions officer\ncandidates as second lieutenants in the United States Air Force. AFROTC:\nProvides ethics and values education, stressing the Air Force core values of integrity first, service\nbefore self, and excellence in all we do.\nPrepares cadets to be commissioned as second lieutenants through a curriculum which develops\nleadership and management skills and provides opportunities to use these skills in a variety of\npractical applications.\nProvides an understanding of how to lead and influence small organizations, with a strong emphasis\non personal integrity, honor, and individual responsibility. The techniques of effective leadership andquality management are stressed to achieve mission accomplishment.\nEnhances the cadets' understanding of the role of the military in society and provides an in-depth\norientation to history and tradition of the Air Force and how the Air Force serves the nation. This\ngoal is reinforced by summer hands-on leadership training and career orientation opportunities at\nAir Force bases around the country.\nIn conjunction with the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, provides programs and experiences which\nincrease self-confidence, self-discipline, accountability, physical stamina, poise, and other traits\nessential to the development of a leader of character who is prepared to serve the nation or the\ncommonwealth both in and out of uniform.\nThe curriculum and leader development programs of the Department of Aerospace Studies are mentally\nand physically challenging. Cadets learn basic military skills and participate in a demanding physical\nconditioning program starting in the freshman year. The program moves progressively from followership\nto leadership experiences and culminates with the senior class cadets planning, organizing, and\nadministering all leadership training for the cadet group. On-campus instruction is conducted both in the\nclassroom by Air Force officers and in the field environment by both officer and cadet leaders.\nSemiannual visits to Air Force bases expand the cadets' knowledge of Air Force operations and life-style.\nA demanding summer field training encampment prior to the junior year prepares the cadet for\nacceptance into the commissioning track.\nAir Force ROTC offers four-, and three-year tracks. Four- and three-year track cadets must complete 8\nsemester hours of AFROTC academics prior to a three-week summer encampment. Students who have\nJunior ROTC, other-service ROTC, national guard, reserve, or active duty military experience may\nrequest credit and advanced placement.\nScholarships\nAir Force ROTC offers four-, three-, and two-year scholarships which are based on merit, not need.\nThough scholarship awards vary, most pay all/partial tuition, books, and approved university fees.

Benoit\nWeb: www.biol.vt.eduOverview\nThe Department of Biological Sciences offers two B.S. degree paths: the B.S. in Biological Sciences and\nthe B.S. in Microbiology.\nThe B.S. in Biological Sciences program provides majors with a broad education in the study of life. This\ncurriculum exposes students to the fundamentals of the discipline: genetics, cell and molecular biology,\nevolutionary biology, and ecology. In addition, Biological Sciences majors may take advantage of elective\ncourses on topics such as macromolecular structure, pathogenic bacteriology, cancer biology, infectious\ndisease ecology, human genetics, and global change ecology. Students may choose to complete an\noption in one of the following three areas: Biomedical; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB); or Biology\nEducation.\nThe B.S. in Microbiology program provides majors with a more focused education in the biology and roles\nof microscopic life forms present in our environments. The laboratory-intensive curriculum provides\nknowledge in the genetics and physiology common to all microbes and allows students to explore specific\ninterests with a broad range of advanced electives such as pathogenic bacteriology, immunology,\nenvironmental microbiology, food microbiology, virology, microbial forensics, and bioinformatics.\nModern biology increasingly relies on knowledge, skills, and perspectives associated with other scientific\nfields, particularly chemistry, mathematics, physics and statistics. Success in biological sciences-\nassociated careers requires students to master the fundamentals of these cognate fields and to be able to\napply these skill sets.\nAs a scientific discipline, biology is more than simple knowledge about living organisms. By integrating\neducation and research, our majors are training to be leaders in their field who practice innovative and\ninterdisciplinary approaches in biological research. By participating in undergraduate research during the\nacademic year, our students are discovering through hands-on experience what it means to Invent the\nFuture. Our majors are strongly encouraged to explore internships and research opportunities on campus\nand elsewhere during the summer.\nThe majority of our graduates continue on to advanced studies in the health professions or in various\nbranches of the biological sciences. Graduates pursue professional degrees in medicine, dentistry,\nveterinary medicine, pharmacy, and nursing, or M.S. or Ph.D. degrees in ecology, environmental biology,microbiology, botany, zoology, cell biology, molecular biology, and biomedical sciences. Students\ninterested in entering the workforce are provided the core background for opportunities in biotechnology,\nfood science, bioinformatics, bio-business, and health-related industries.\nPreparation for Advanced Study\nGraduate Study\nStudents who satisfactorily complete the undergraduate curriculum in biological sciences or microbiology\nmay pursue advanced studies leading to the M.S. or Ph.D. in various branches of the biological sciences.\nThose interested in teaching science are prepared to pursue the M.A.Ed.\nPreparation for Medicine\nThe training afforded by the first three years (approximately 96 hours) meets the pre-medical training\nrequirements of medical colleges that accept students with only three years of undergraduate work. It is\nstrongly recommended, however, that all students complete a B.S. before entering medical school.\nPreparation for Dentistry\nDental colleges require a minimum of three years of college training for admission, but it is generally\nadvisable for students to complete the B.S. before entering dental school.\nPreparation for Allied Health Professions\nSchools of Allied Health Professions, such as nursing, pharmacy, medical technology, physical therapy,\netc., require two or more years of college work for admission. Specific requirements are available from\nCareer Services or the Biological Sciences Department.\nPreparation for Veterinary Medicine\nVeterinary schools require a minimum of three years of college training for admission. Few students who\nmeet only the minimum entrance requirements are accepted by veterinary schools.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nMinor Requirements\nThe requirements to earn a minor in Biology can be found on its checksheet by visiting the University\nRegistrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meetminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\")\nand toward the degree.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the B.S. in Biological Sciences and the B.S. in Microbiology\ncan be found on their major checksheets by visiting the University Registrar website at\nhttp://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (BIOL)\n1004: BIOLOGY ORIENTATION SEMINAR\nAn introduction to academic and career planning for majors in Biology and students who may be\nconsidering Biology as a major.

The department also offers and staffs business courses, including:\nquantitative models and methods in business, operations and supply chain management, and computer\nmodeling and simulation in business. Business Information Technology (BIT) courses are listed below.\nThe department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may\nalternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment.\nBusiness Information Technology\nThe curriculum in business information technology is designed to provide the student with expertise in the\nquantitative and technological aspects of management, specifically including the extensive use of\ncomputers for solving business problems and making managerial decisions. The name business\ninformation technology implies the application of scientific principles and techniques, mathematics, and\ncomputing to the management function with the objective of increased efficiency and productivity. Thus,\nthe student of business information technology not only learns various quantitative techniques and\nmodels to apply to managerial problems, but also a logical and scientific approach to managerial\ndecision-making. The curriculum provides training both for individuals interested in pursuing careers in\nbusiness management and for individuals interested in pursuing graduate or professional degrees.\nStudents majoring in business information technology may choose one of two options reflecting their\nparticular career objectives and interests.\nOption I - Computer-Based Decision Support Systems\nThis option educates the student in the design, implementation, and use of computerized information\nsystems, decision support systems, and expert systems which support contemporary business managers\nin the decision-making process. Special emphasis is placed on increased productivity through the use of\nmodels, quantitative data, and techniques in the computerized decision support system. Training in\nOption I will enable graduates of this program to pursue careers in business and industry in which\ncomputer-aided decision-making is an essential component of the managerial function.Option II - Operations and Supply Chain Management\nThis option educates students in the management of activities directly related to the creation and\ndistribution of goods and services. The curriculum of Option II is designed to provide the student with\nexpertise in the planning and control of business processes within a firm and across its global supply\nchain. Emphasis is placed on applying IT and process analysis skills to improve the quality and\nproductivity of business firms and their supply chain partners. Graduates of this program will be prepared\nto pursue careers as operations managers, business process analysts, quality assurance specialists,\nsupply chain specialists, and quality control, logistics, inventory and procurement managers in business,\nindustry, and government.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (BIT)\n2405,2406: QUANTITATIVE METHODS\nStudy of quantitative techniques used in managerial decision-making.

Hession, S. Mostaghimi, M.\nL. Wolfe, and C. Zhang\nAssociate Professors: J. Arogo Ogejo, Z. M. Easton, L.-A. H. Krometis, D.J. Sample, D.\nScott, R.S. Senger, V. R. Sridhar, and T. M. Thompson\nAssistant Professors: R. C. Wright, J. A. Czuba, and J. E. Shortridge\nInstructor: S. C. Mariger\nWeb: www.bse.vt.edu\nOverview\nThe Biological Systems Engineering program integrates biology, chemistry, and physics with engineering\nto solve engineering problems associated with the environmentally sound production, processing, and\nutilization of renewable resources. The curriculum differs from other engineering programs in that it\nfocuses on the sustainable production of biological products and the management of natural resources.\nBiological Systems Engineering graduates have rewarding careers working with biological materials and\nboth large and small biological systems, for the benefit of society and the environment.\nThe BSE program is designed to graduate biological systems engineers who will be leaders in applying\nengineering principles to biological systems, preparing graduates to accomplish the following objectives in\ntheir careers:\ndesign and implement systems that mimic or adapt natural biological processes to solve problemsrelated to conservation and restoration of natural resources;\ndesign and implement processes to utilize biological materials for sustainable production of valuable\nproducts;\npromote stewardship of natural resources; and\ncontribute effectively as members of multidisciplinary groups that include scientists, engineers, and\ncommunity members.\nThese educational objectives are supported by a curriculum that provides its graduates with:\nan ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering\nan ability to design and conduct experiments as well as analyze and interpret data\nan ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic\nconstraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety,\nmanufacturability, and sustainability\nan ability to function on multidisciplinary teams\nan ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems\nan understanding of professional and ethical responsibility\nan ability to communicate effectively\nthe broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in global and\nsocietal context\na recognition of need for, and ability to engage in lifelong learning\na knowledge of contemporary issues\nan ability to use techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice\nThe BSE program provides a strong, broad-based engineering education with opportunity for\nspecialization utilizing the 33 credits of technical electives available in the curriculum. Using these\nelectives, BSE students prepare for careers in biomedical engineering, biotechnology,\nbiopharmaceuticals, food engineering, or watershed science and engineering. Many BSE graduates also\nchoose to pursue graduate studies or professional degrees from medical, veterinary, or dental programs.\nRecognizing the importance of \"hands-on\" experience in engineering education, instructional laboratories\nare included in many of the Biological Systems Engineering courses. These laboratory courses are\ndesigned to enhance understanding of theoretical concepts through hands-on activities. In addition to\nproviding a strong and broad-based engineering education, the program emphasizes communication,\nteam work skills, and design experience. The department participates in the Cooperative Education\nProgram, which gives qualified students valuable work experience while pursuing an undergraduate\ndegree. Students are also encouraged to participate in undergraduate research and study abroad\nprograms. Many BSE students are employed in departmental research laboratories.\nDesign and teamwork experiences are integral parts of the program. In the second year, students work in\nteams to design, build, and test a solution to an assigned design problem. Throughout the junior year,\nstudents acquire knowledge and analytical skills required for successful and professional engineering\ndesign through course assignments. The senior year design sequence gives students a comprehensive\ndesign experience in which they utilize much of the knowledge they have acquired through their other\ncourses. Students work in teams to solve \"real-life\" engineering problems.\nThe Bachelor of Science in biological systems engineering is offered through the College of Engineering\nand is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.\nThe relatively small class sizes in Biological Systems Engineering promote excellent interaction between\nfaculty and students.\nThe department offers over 20 endowed scholarships to students enrolled in Biological Systems\nEngineering; students are also eligible for College of Engineering and other university scholarships.\nIn addition to the undergraduate degree program, programs of study leading to master of engineering,Master of Science, and Ph.D. degrees are available in the department. The BSE department also\nparticipates in the Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate degree program. Through this program,\nundergraduate students with a GPA of 3.4 or above can apply for admission to the Graduate School\nduring their junior year. If admitted, students may apply up to 12 hours of graduate coursework to both\ntheir graduate and undergraduate degree requirements, thus accelerating completion of a master's\ndegree in BSE.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (BSE)\n2004: INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING\nIntroduction to the fundamental concepts of Biological Systems Engineering, including statistics, heat and\nmass balances, protein separation, microbial metabolism, and enzyme kinetics.

The Bachelor of Science program in Civil Engineering is\naccredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.Emphasis in civil engineering education is on fundamental principles of science and mathematics and\ntheir application to solving human problems. Civil engineering activities interact in many ways with the\nnatural and social environments within which they take place. Accordingly, the civil engineering program\nstrives to create an awareness of the ecological, social, economic, and political context of engineering\nand attempts to prepare the civil engineer for the necessary interactions with other professions and the\npublic. An effort to instill an understanding of the role of the civil engineer in satisfying total societal needs\nis an integral part of the civil engineering program.\nConsistent with the general program goal of facilitating development of student competence necessary for\nentry into engineering practice or graduate school, the Department has developed the following program\nobjectives:\nThe educational objectives of the Civil Engineering undergraduate program are that, within a few years of\nprogram completion, graduates should be effectively serving society as practicing civil engineers and in\nrelated capacities with a commitment to design, construction, and maintenance practices that will\ncontribute to sustainable development, provide for the continued well-being of spaces and infrastructure,\nand hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public. Additionally, the program's graduates\nshould continue to grow both technically and professionally so that they develop into leaders within their\nchosen fields of endeavor. Growth experiences could include activities such as professional licensure,\ngraduate level education, self-directed study, and participation in professional society activities.\nThe curriculum provides a common freshman and sophomore year, with selection of upper division\ncourses made during course request for the second semester of the sophomore year. The civil\nengineering curriculum provides breadth across the civil engineering profession and the opportunity for\ndepth within a student's selected specialty areas of interest. Specialty areas offered within the department\ninclude: construction engineering & management, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering,\nland development, civil engineering materials, structural engineering, transportation engineering, and\nwater resources engineering.\nStudents are progressively exposed to civil engineering design, culminating in a focused design course\nexperience. The projects assigned in design courses are open-ended, incorporate appropriate\nengineering standards, and require the application of knowledge from earlier courses in the curriculum.\nProjects apply technical knowledge to design appropriate physical facilities, but also include consideration\nof non-technical constraints that confront real-world projects. These additional considerations include\nsuch interdisciplinary issues as economics, environmental impact, and sustainability. Accordingly,\nteamwork and good professional communications skills are a significant part of each design project\ncourse experience.\nClassroom instruction in the civil engineering program is reinforced by instructional laboratories in the\nmajor areas of civil engineering practice. The department seeks to employ the latest educational\ntechnology and innovative teaching methods.\nThe department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may\nalternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment. The department encourages all\nstudents to participate in professional work experience prior to graduation.\nContact person for undergraduate Civil and Environmental Engineering programs is Kara Lattimer, CEE\nAcademic and Career Advisor at (540) 231-7148 or e-mail: karalatt@vt.edu.\nFull programs of graduate study are available, leading to the M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D. in civil engineering.\nGraduate degree programs concentrate in one of five major areas: construction engineering and\nmanagement, environmental and water resources engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural\nengineering and materials, and transportation and infrastructure systems engineering. For details, see the\nGraduate Catalog.\nCivil Engineering Program\nAdmission to a degree program is competitive, with departmental restrictions established each year by thecollege. Entry into a degree-granting department requires that a student complete all first year required\ncourses and maintain a competitive GPA. Applicants who begin their freshman year in the College of\nEngineering and earn a minimum 3.0 overall are guaranteed first choice of major.

Whether these problems involve\nenergy, food, health, materials or environmental quality, the modern chemical engineer is the professional\nconcerned with finding economically and socially acceptable solutions. The program prepares graduates\nfor employment in a great variety of industries including specialty chemicals, petroleum, pharmaceutics,\npaper, fibers, plastics, food, electronics, consumer products, and environmental remediation. Studentsmay customize their academic program around an industry of their interest by judiciously selecting\nelectives. For example, areas of focus such as polymers, biotechnology, marketing, and environmental\nchemical engineering are common choices.\nThe objective of the undergraduate program is to produce chemical engineering graduates who, within\nfive years of completing the BS degree, will be successful in a variety of professional careers, including\nthose outside of traditional chemical engineering fields as evidenced by one or more of the following\nachievements:\nSustaining a career as a problem solver in engineering or other fields that require analytical skills\nProfessional advancement in positions of increasing leadership and/or responsibility within their\nchosen career field\nAttainment of an advanced degree or advanced certification leading to a career in engineering or\nscience, business, law, medicine, or academia\nBettering society through professional or personal service\nThe curriculum has been developed to meet the department goal and the objectives for the graduates.\nThe curriculum is demanding and a GPA of at least 3.0 is recommended for transfer into the program at\nthe sophomore level. An average GPA of at least 2.00 in all CHE courses attempted (except CHE 4144)\nis required for continued enrollment in the department. The department has specific grade policies for\ncontinuation in the program and for graduation. For further information on these policies, please contact\nthe department.\nThe chemical engineering curriculum integrates studies in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat\ntransfer, mass transfer, process control, reaction kinetics, plant and process design, verbal and written\ncommunications, and reaction kinetics, along with professional ethics and environmental awareness.\nThroughout this curriculum students learn the elements of the design of chemical processes and chemical\nprocessing equipment. In addition, students gain hands-on experience with the equipment during the\nsummer Unit Operations Laboratory. The experience culminates in participation in either a national\nsenior-level design contest or a design project with a local industrial mentor. The laboratory and the\nsenior design courses are recognized as two of the high points in the undergraduate program. The\ncomputer is a necessary tool in all the courses and the same software used in industry is used in the\ndesign courses.\nIn addition to the basic undergraduate program outlined here, more sophisticated and specialized\nprograms leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering also are offered (see Graduate\nCatalog).\nThe department participates in the Cooperative Education Program whereby qualified students may\nalternate periods of study with periods of professional employment.\nChemical Engineering Program\nA total of 135 semester credits are required for graduation in 2019.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nThe following are special focus areas students can use as electives.

Kokkinakos\nDirector of General Chemistry: P. G. Amateis\nWeb: www.chem.vt.eduOverview\nThe Chemistry Department offers two undergraduate programs: the B.S. in Chemistry and the B.A. in\nChemistry. The B.S. curriculum provides the breadth and depth to give graduates a wide choice of career\noptions, including further graduate studies. The Chemistry Department is accredited by the American\nChemical Society's Committee on Professional Training and the B.S. degree meets the guidelines for an\nACS-certified degree. The B.A. program has fewer required chemistry courses, allowing students to\ndesign a chemistry program with more electives to meet a wider set of career goals. The B.A. is often\nchosen by students who wish to pursue a double major or to take other courses to prepare for\nprofessional school, law, or business. Either the B.S. or the B.A. degree is suitable to prepare for high\nschool teaching. The Chemistry Department supports and encourages all chemistry majors to pursue\nundergraduate research sometime during their degree program.\nGraduate Program\nThe Department offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees with specializations in many areas of chemistry. (See the\nGraduate Catalog for further information.)\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.Minor Requirements\nThe requirements to earn a minor in Chemistry can be found on the specific checksheet by visiting the\nUniversity Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet\nminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\")\nand toward the degree.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. and B.S. in Chemistry can be found on the major\nchecksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (CHEM)\n1004: FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE IN CHEMISTRY\nOrientation to the Chemistry Department and to the discipline of chemistry for chemistry majors and for\nindividuals considering CHEM as a major, including transfer students.

    "Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE)": "Why We Have It\nWhat Students Will Gain\nCurriculum for Liberal Education (CLE) Areas of Study\nWhy We Have It\nAs a vital component of undergraduate education at Virginia Tech, the Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE)-\n-required of all undergraduates--empowers our students with a broad base of knowledge and transferable\nskills. Liberal Education provides students the opportunity for rigorous intellectual encounters with enduring\nhuman challenges and important contemporary problems, through wide-ranging exposure to multiple\ndisciplines and ways of knowing.\nThrough the study of the Sciences, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Histories, Languages and the Arts, the CLE\nis designed to foster and develop intellectual curiosity and critical thinking; strong analytic, communication,\nquantitative, and information literacy skills; the capacity for collaboration and creative problem solving; the\nability to synthesize and transfer knowledge; intercultural knowledge and understanding; and ethical reasoning\nand action. The CLE seeks to create the conditions for growing creative and intellectual engagement; civic,\npersonal, and social responsibility; and lifelong learning.\nWhat Students Will Gain\nA liberal education offers 21st century students the foundations of what they need to live and thrive as citizens\nin a globally engaged democracy, a knowledge-intensive economy, and a society where new ideas and\nunderstandings are essential to progress. The success of today's college students in their communities,\nworkplaces, and across their lifetimes depends upon a complex and transferable set of skills and capacities. In\ntheir lives and in their careers, our students must be prepared to grasp complex problems, develop a global\nperspective on the diversity of human experience and knowledge, respond to changing demands, and\narticulate innovative responses and solutions. Today's students are very likely to change jobs and even\ncareers several times over the course of their lives; and certainly, their roles and responsibilities in their\nfamilies and communities will change and evolve over their lifetimes as well.\nThe breadth of a rigorous liberal education combined with the depth of specialized study in the student's\nprimary academic discipline(s)--and evidenced in a demonstrated capacity to adapt and transfer knowledge,\nskills, and responsibilities to new settings and questions--is essential to the education of the whole studentand sets the stage for a lifetime of learning and growth.\nCurriculum for Liberal Education (CLE) Areas of Study\nBecause the Curriculum for Liberal Education is a \"living curriculum,\" there will be some changes from year to\nyear. Courses added to the CLE offerings are generally available to students immediately after being\napproved. Some requirements of the CLE are phased in over a multi-year period. Thus, it is essential that\nstudents continue to consult with their advisors. Please visit the CLE homepage at\nhttp://www.cle.prov.vt.edu/ for more information, and for the Curriculum for Liberal Education Guides.\nAreas of Study\nArea 1: Writing and Discourse 6 Credit Hours\nArea 2: Ideas, Cultural Traditions, and Values 6 Credit Hours\nArea 3: Society and Human Behavior 6 Credit Hours\nArea 4: Scientific Reasoning and Discovery 6 or 8 Credit Hours\nArea 5: Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning 6 Credit Hours\nArea 6: Creativity and Aesthetic Experience 1 or 3 Credit Hours\nArea 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context 3 Credit Hours\n**Students should consult with their advisors about specific college or departmental requirements in these\nareas.\nArea 1: Writing and Discourse\n6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses. Students who entered the university prior to\nFall 2005 and maintain continuous enrollment until graduation must meet the previous Writing Intensive (WI)\nrequirement.\nArea 1 requirements reflect the centrality of discourse in the larger intellectual community. Our first-year\nwriting courses introduce students to the interrelated and shared modes of verbal communication that are\ndistinctive to college life - argument, interpretation, analysis, and metaphor - and whose various usages\nsubstantially delineate what it means to become broadly educated. These beginning courses should be\nthought of as the springboard for further writing and discourse throughout the undergraduate curriculum,\nespecially in the disciplinary concentration.\nIn order to enable students to meet the aims of both liberal education and of professional preparation, we\ninclude writing in many courses throughout the university, even if it may not be the main intellectual capacity\nemphasized in the course. Students are encouraged to seek out courses that offer frequent opportunities for\nwriting and related forms of discourse, both for the enhanced learning these courses can offer and for their\nbene t in terms of professional preparation. Many courses in the Curriculum for Liberal Education build upon\nthe writing and oral skills that are the direct goal of Area 1 by including a significant writing component and by\nencouraging the achievement of excellence in communicating ideas and knowledge.\nFormerly, the CLE required writing-intensive (WI) courses to support the development of students' writing\nskills across the undergraduate career. To better facilitate and broaden this goal, the requirement evolved into\na departmental requirement for Visual, Spoken and Written Expression (ViEWS). Development of these\ncompetencies may be fostered through specific courses in the major, courses outside the major, and/or\npreviously designated WI courses.\nStudents may meet the first-year writing requirement in one of three ways:\nBy successful completion of the two-semester sequence, ENGL 1105-1106 or COMM 1015-1016\nBy successful completion of ENGL 1106 for students who are awarded Advanced Standing (based on\nstandardized test scores and high school class rank) and are placed in ENGL 1106. Advanced Standingstudents who complete ENGL 1106 at Virginia Tech in the rst enrollment with a C- or better receive\nAdvanced Standing credit for ENGL 1105;\nBy successful completion of 1204H for students who meet University Honors Standards or English\nDepartment Honors Standards. Honors students who successfully complete ENGL 1204H at Virginia\nTech in the rst enrollment with a C- or better receive Advanced Standing credit for ENGL 1105.\nOther Information: Virginia Tech accepts ETS Advanced Placement credit for the Freshman Writing\nsequence.\nArea 2: Ideas, Cultural Traditions, and Values\n6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses.\nEvery student should be introduced to some of the ideas, cultural traditions, and values that have shaped the\nhuman world we now inhabit. An educated person sees the present in connection with the past, and\nunderstands that presently prevailing values and meanings derive from the creative thought and action of men\nand women who have preceded us. A study of in uential texts, ideas, representative works of art and\ntechnology, and the development of cultural traditions begins to free the student from the super cial fads of the\nmoment and from narrow provincialisms. By examining some of the enduring ideas about human nature and\nachievement past and present, the individual gains a greater degree of self- knowledge and is better able to\nformulate worthwhile aims and commitments.\nCourses in this curricular area take the human condition and human values as their main focus, while dealing\nwith a range of subject matters: philosophy, literature and communication, history, religion, the arts, and\ntechnology. Most of these courses deal with some aspect of Western cultural experience in its numerous\nvarieties. Relatively neglected dimensions of this experience such as the experience of women and minorities\nwill be acknowledged and dealt with, both as an integral aspect of many existing courses and in separate\ncourses which focus directly upon these dimensions. The foreign language courses approved for Area 2\nexplore the literatures of other countries in their cultural contexts. Moreover, since we are living in an\nincreasingly global cultural context, courses are included that introduce the student to formative non-Western\nideas, arts, and traditions as well.\nArea 3: Society and Human Behavior\n6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses.\nHuman beings are not only participants in the world of human culture; we are also observers of it. The\ncultivation of systematic approaches to the study of humanity is one of the great achievements of the human\nintellect. Every student should therefore be introduced to the sciences of society and human behavior, a goal\nthat can be accomplished through several avenues: through the study of psychology; through the study of\nsocial structures such as government, family, community, or economy; or through more wide-ranging\nexamination of social patterns and processes. Such studies may examine past as well as present, non-\nWestern as well as Western societies.\nCourses in this curricular area are best characterized by their methods of study and theoretical frameworks.\nThey look for regularities in human behavior rather than giving primary attention to the unique or non-\nrepeatable aspects of life. When varied human values and allegiances nevertheless make their appearance\nwithin these disciplines, they do so more as objects to be investigated than as commitments to be honored.\nArea 4: Scientific Reasoning and Discovery\n6 credit hours (2 courses) of lecture selected from approved CLE courses. Some majors require 2 credit hours\nof related laboratory (2 labs).\nFor many students at Virginia Tech, acquiring detailed knowledge of one or more of the natural sciences is\nessential. But for all students, a liberal education involves the study of what science is, of how it can be\nconducted, of what it can and cannot tell us about the world. Without scientific study and the experience\noffered by a laboratory, students perceive only vaguely how and why science functions as a crucial standard\nfor knowledge and inquiry in modern life. The study of a science engages the student in analysis anddeduction as well as empirical experimentation - that is, in scientific reasoning and discovery.\nThe impact of the natural sciences and technology on our globally interdependent world is one of the most\nimportant realities we face as we enter the 21st century. The science courses in the CLE have a special role\nin educating students about the critical relevance of scientific knowledge to the potentialities and dilemmas of\nour natural and social environments.\nArea 5: Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning\n6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses\nLike writing, mathematics is essential to intellectual inquiry in many areas. It is a basic language of the natural\nand social sciences and has become a useful tool for research in the humanities. The technological uses of\nmathematics and related forms of symbolic analysis are of tremendous significance to human society.\nFurthermore, the history of quantitative and symbolic reasoning as an intellectual discipline is linked with\nphilosophy, the arts, and other aspects of human culture. Thus, a broad education must include these forms of\nreasoning, both as skills and as central modes of thought. Mathematics, statistics, and certain areas of\ncomputer science and philosophy can all contribute to broadening a student's knowledge of quantitative and\nsymbolic reasoning.\nA diagnostic formula and testing procedure has been derived to predict readiness for Engineering/Science\nCalculus at Virginia Tech. A purpose of MATH 1015 is to serve those students who need further preparation.\nYou can obtain information about the math diagnostic test from your advisor.\nMany departments throughout the university have specific math sequence requirements. Be sure to check with\nyour advisor about the requirements for your program.\nArea 6: Creativity and Aesthetic Experience\n1 or 3 credit hours selected from approved CLE courses. Students in the College of Science and most majors\nin the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences must take one (1) 3-credit hour course. Students should\nconsult with their advisors about specific college or departmental requirements.\nThe arts contribute significantly both to the experience and the interpretation of human life. Creativity and\naesthetic response criss-cross the boundaries among intellectual ideas, the imagination, and actual design.\nMoreover, the arts are always intimately linked with the material culture of a society \u2014 its modes of production\nand design \u2014 as well as with its values and ideas. Thus, the arts can be studied and experienced in a variety\nof ways: as \"high culture,\" as a means of tracing the history and ideas of particular societies, and as an active\nprocess of creative design and expression in many different physical forms. The metaphorical and intuitive\nthought processes that are essential to making and experiencing works of art are woven into many other\nhuman cultural and creative activities. Thus, the arts have an important role to play in broadening our\naesthetic and intellectual sensibilities. Most artistic media include a highly public dimension - concerts,\nexhibitions, performances, publications, public installations, and the built environment - in which the creative\nworks of artists, designers, and their collaborators are accepted or contested as meaningful elements of the\nlarger social fabric. A guided exposure to the arts can provide a valuable framework for continued appreciation\nof, and participation in, the arts beyond college.\nArea 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context\n3 credit hours (1 course) selected from approved CLE courses.\nGlobal interdependence is a powerful fact of life as we enter the 21st century. The dilemmas and possibilities\nhumankind faces cannot be effectively addressed by any single culture or group of people acting alone. An\nawareness of critical issues of the day is thus an essential extension of liberal education and prepares\nstudents to respond thoughtfully to the complex world in which they live. As a state institution of higher\neducation, Virginia Tech has a responsibility to prepare students to react creatively and constructively to the\nsocial, international, intercultural, and environmental challenges that confront the Commonwealth and the\nworld.The university requires that undergraduates take at least one course that deals in a substantial way with major\nissues of critical importance for the larger global society. Courses that satisfy this requirement can be taken in\nany area of the curriculum, including the major, the Curriculum for Liberal Education, or electives. Students\nmay select from a wide range of courses that focus on major international and intercultural issues in\ncontemporary world affairs, including such areas as politics, the management of con ict, the roles of economic\ncompetition and cooperation, demographic issues, and the emerging world order. Many science courses in\nArea 7 examine global issues associated with environmental decline and restoration. Some engineering\ncourses study the role of technology as a major force in shaping the cultural and economic conditions of\nhuman societies. Other courses include comparative or cross-disciplinary examinations of cultures, societies,\nand belief systems, including those of developing countries. Other courses examine the social and personal\nimplications of cultural, racial, and gender-based differences. Whatever the topical focus of the course, all\nArea 7 courses utilize interdisciplinary approaches in which a number of relevant factors - historical, ethical,\ntechnological, cultural, and/or scientific - are brought to bear on the issues being studied.\n\u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University\nRegistrarMenu\n2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and",

Woolly\nWeb: www.liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-\ncommunication.htmlOverview\nThe majors in communication, leading to a B.A., allow students to develop a broad understanding of the\ndiscipline and specific expertise in Communication Studies, Multimedia Journalism, or Public Relations.\nThe Department of Communication focuses on strategic, theoretical, and practical application of message\ncreation, delivery, analysis, and criticism in cultural and historical contexts.\nStudents in communication majors are prepared to continue their studies in graduate school or\nimmediately apply their skills in various professional settings because of the broad applicability of both the\ntheory to which they are exposed and the competencies they develop. Rooted in a strong liberal arts\ncurriculum, these majors prepare students to enter careers in mass media, business, public service,\ngovernment, or professional specializations, such as law.\nMajors\nStudents choose one of three majors in communication to specialize in the discipline: Communication\nStudies, Multimedia Journalism, and Public Relations. Multimedia Journalism offers a concentration in\nSports Media and Analytics.\nCommunication Studies (CMST) - This major develops human-interaction strategies and skills for face-\nto-face, public, and organizational contexts relating to decision making, influence, and information\nexchange. As a graduate, you might consider careers in business, health, civic engagement, public\nopinion, law, education, and ministry.\nPublic Relations (PR) - This major emphasizes both skill and management functions of public relations\nthrough theoretical and practical applications. Public relations spans media, organizational, corporate,\nand political contexts and includes investigation and analysis of public relations situations (e.g., crises,\nsuccesses), message production and campaign planning, writing and presentation, and evaluation of\npublic relations strategies. Public relations permeates many areas of corporate, non-profit, and political\nwork, so this major provides students a foundation for many different career paths.\nMultimedia Journalism (MJ) - This major prepares students for news careers at newspapers,\nmagazines, broadcast and cable outlets, and new media operations. The lines that separate these\nspecialties are blurring as media convergence becomes more the norm. Courses provide both practicalskills and theory as they address history, law and ethics, current controversies and opportunities in the\nchanging news media.\nSports Media and Analytics (Concentration) - This concentration enables students to complete the MJ\ncurriculum while specializing in Sports Media and Analytics. In addition to mastering the content and skills\nof MJ, you will participate in the production and delivery of sports news, consider ways to promote the\nsports industry with your study of public relations, and analyze data related to sports accomplishments,\nfan participation, and social media. The employment opportunities are myriad and include sports\nreporting, public relations for sports venues, teams, and/or athletes, and promotional work for businesses\nthat support the fans.\nMajor Requirements\nThe curriculum is designed to provide foundational and development courses along with major-specific\nstudy. Students are introduced to concepts early in the undergraduate career, and the curriculum allows\nthem to build knowledge and skills as they work on increasingly complex tasks. Students develop skills in\nwritten, spoken, and visual communication across their studies in the major. At the foundational level,\nstudents in every major are required to take the same introductory courses.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When you consider information\nabout the degree requirements, always choose the year of your expected graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are listed on checksheets. The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies\namong curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for\ndegree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nMinor Requirements\nThe department offers a minor in strategic communication. This multidisciplinary minor is open to majors\nfrom across the university and is especially appropriate for students in business or science, technology,\nengineering, and mathematics disciplines. Coursework allows students to learn how strategic\ncommunication works in a variety of industries and prepare for the 21st century workforce. Few jobs have\nno communication components.\nThe minor curriculum introduces students to strategic communication through a four-course introductory\nexperience. It covers basic communication skills, public relations, design, and accounting. Introductory\ncoursework requires students to integrate multiple areas of learning such as discourse, quantitative and\ncomputational thinking, reasoning in the social sciences, critique and practice in design and the arts,\ninternational and cultural awareness, and understanding ethical issues. Two advanced courses enable\nstudents to focus on particular issues in strategic communication, such as issues management, corporate\nsocial responsibility, or communication law. A capstone course lets students synthesize and analyze\ntopics and issues they explored in the four foundational and two advanced courses.\nSpecific course requirements for the 18-hour strategic communication minor are explained on a\nchecksheet.\nSatisfactory Progress Toward the Degree\nUniversity policy requires that students demonstrate their progress toward the degree by meetingminimum requirements. A student will be certified as making satisfactory progress toward a degree by\nmeeting the following requirements:\nCompletion of COMM 1014 within the first six classes (18 hours) in the major\nCompletion of COMM 2124 within the first eight classes (24 hours) in the major\nOverall GPA: 2.0\nCOMM GPA: 2.0\nStudents who fall below the standard for either the overall GPA or the COMM GPA will have one\nsemester to regain the required GPA standards. A student who fails to make satisfactory progress toward\ndegree after that semester will be blocked from continuing in any communication major.\nFreshmen and External Transfers into Communication\nIncoming freshmen and students enrolled at other institutions should follow directions for application as\nshown on the Admissions website.\nInternal Transfers into Communication\nStudents enrolled in other Virginia Tech majors who wish to transfer into Communication may use the\nonline system for application.\nDepartmental Website and Contact\nPlease see the Departmental Website for more information about majors and the minor:\nwww.liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-communication.html\nContact: comm@vt.edu\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (COMM)\n1004: FIRST-SEMESTER EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNICATION\nIntroduction to areas of research, ethical behaviors, and career paths in the discipline.

Alumni will have:\nDemonstrated technical expertise by applying computer science knowledge and practice to solve\nchallenging problems, whether in employment, graduate study, or individual pursuits;\nAdvanced their skills in communication, teamwork, and professional and ethical behavior;\nDemonstrated leadership in their technical or professional pursuits;\nEngaged in post-graduate learning through graduate studies, professional improvement\nopportunities, or self-study;\nServed society through professional or personal contribution.\nDesired outcomes for graduates are organized into the following six areas:\nFoundations of computing: ability to apply knowledge of mathematics and science to carry out\nanalysis of computer science problems and design appropriate solutions; ability to use techniques,\nskills, and modern software development tools necessary for computing practice.\nDepth of knowledge: ability to identify, formulate, and solve computer science problems; ability to\ndesign a computing system to meet desired needs; ability to apply problem-solving strategies to\nnew, unknown, or open-ended situations in computer science.\nBreadth of knowledge: knowledge and understanding of the impact of the many sub-disciplines of\ncomputer science.\nCommunication skills: ability to function in teams; ability to use written and oral communication skills\neffectively.\nProfessional ethics: understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.\nLifelong learning: recognition of the need for and ability to engage in lifelong learning; ability toacquire and use the ever-changing technical knowledge required of computing professionals.\nProgram Requirements\nThe curriculum in computer science is designed to provide a broad general computer science background\nthat will prepare a student for a professional career as a computer scientist or to continue study at the\ngraduate level. All majors take a set of foundational courses in software design and development,\nalgorithms, and computer organization at the freshmen and sophomore level. Students at the junior and\nsenior level select one theoretical course, four specialty courses and a capstone course according to their\nindividual interests within the field.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nOpportunities for Majors\nThe curriculum in computer science is designed to provide a broad general computer science background\nthat will prepare a student for a professional career as a computer scientist or to continue study at the\ngraduate level. All majors take a set of foundational courses in software design and development,\nalgorithms, and computer organization at the freshman and sophomore level. Students at the junior and\nsenior level select one theoretical course, four specialty courses and a capstone course according to their\nindividual interests within the field. In all, a minimum of 44 credit hours of computer science is required.\nThe department offers computer science majors the opportunity to enhance their education through a\nvariety of curricular and extracurricular activities. Students who meet the requirements for independent\nstudy or undergraduate research can pursue research or individualized study under the direction of a\nfaculty member. Through the honors program, superior students can work toward earning their degree \"in\nhonors\" or even elect to earn both the bachelor's and master's degrees in an accelerated\nundergraduate/graduate program. The Cooperative Education Program makes it possible for students to\nacquire professional experience while pursuing their degree.\nThe department sponsors chapters of three national computer science organizations: the Association for\nComputing Machinery (ACM), the national professional organization for computer scientists; the\nAssociation for Women in Computing (AWC), which is dedicated to the advancement of women in\ninformation technology fields; and Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE), the national computer science honor society.\nAdditional recognition of student achievements is made during the annual graduation ceremonies. Among\nthe awards given are the Gorsline award, awarded to a rising senior who has overcome freshman-year\nacademic difficulties and subsequently demonstrated great academic achievement.\nInformation for Non-Majors\nThe department offers a Computer Science minor for non-majors seeking a strong background in\ncomputer science. The requirements to earn a minor in Computer Science can be found on its\nchecksheet by visiting the University Registrar website atwww.registrar.vt.edu/graduation/checksheets/index.html. Minors must meet the same prerequisites\nas majors. This includes Math 2534 as a co-requisite for CS 2505 and achievement of a \"C\" (2.0) or\nbetter in all CS courses which are prerequisites for subsequent CS courses.\nComputational Facilities\nThe Department of Computer Science possesses extensive facilities for both instruction and research.\nThere are several undergraduate teaching laboratories and a number of specially equipped research\nlaboratories.

Graduates typically move into farming or into sales, consulting, and managerial\npositions that directly and indirectly support agricultural production, a most vital component of the world's\neconomy.\nCrop Genetics and Breeding Option\nProducing better quality and higher yielding crops has been a long-standing objective of crop breeders.\nNew techniques of genetic engineering are now being brought to bear on crop improvement. Students in\nthis option learn the newest methods of molecular biology and are well prepared for careers in research\nand industry.\nInternational Agriculture Option\nThe world's ever-expanding population must be fed; at the same time, we must be good stewards of the\nEarth's resources. Many countries have not been able to bring food production and resource\nconservation into balance. Students in the International Agriculture option are interested in finding\nsimultaneous solutions to these concerns. Employment opportunities exist with various private and public\nagencies.\nTurfgrass Management Option\nUsing basic principles of the natural sciences and agricultural technology, turf managers have skills that\nmake them highly employable in golf-course management, athletic and recreational fields, lawn\nmaintenance services, the landscaping industry, and sod production.\nRequirements for a Major\nAll the curricula for the various options contain a core of courses to assist the student in developing\nknowledge and ability in basic sciences (biology and chemistry), computational skills (mathematics and\nstatistics), communication skills (both writing and speaking), as well as crop, soil, and environmental\nsciences. A list of courses specified for each option may be obtained upon request from the department\nor at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nRequirements for a Minor\nThe department offers minors in crop and soil environmental sciences, turfgrass management,\nenvironmental science and wetland science.

Cooper\nWeb: www.ece.vt.edu\nOverview\nThe Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers bachelor of science degrees in\nelectrical engineering (EE) and computer engineering (CPE). The difference between these two degrees\nis one of emphasis. Electrical engineering concentrates on physical processes and design in\ncommunications and networking; energy and power electronics systems; controls, robotics, and\nautonomy; micro- and nanoelectronics; space systems; RF and microwaves; and photonics. Computer\nengineering emphasizes the development of computer hardware and associated technical areas, such as\nnetworks and cybersecurity; machine learning; chip-scale integration; controls, robotics and autonomy;\nand software systems. In addition to undergraduate degrees, the department also offers M.S., M.Eng.,\nand Ph.D. programs in both EE and CPE. An accelerated undergraduate/graduate (UG/G) program is\navailable for qualified undergraduates.\nElectrical engineers (EEs) and computer engineers (CPEs) create important and exciting technologies,\nsystems and applications that make the world a better place for all of us. EEs and CPEs are inventing\nnew ways to generate, distribute and use electric power that are more efficient, more sustainable and\nfriendlier to the environment. For example, wider use of solar energy relies on improved photovoltaic\ndevices, power electronics for energy conversion, and power grids. Some of our most critical global\ninfrastructures, including the Internet, mobile voice and data networks, and the electric power grid are\ndesigned by EEs and CPEs. And, EEs and CPEs design sensors and embedded systems to monitor\nintelligent buildings and transportation systems. Applying innovative technologies to biology and the\nhealthcare industry, EEs and CPEs create techniques for medical imaging, micro-electromechanical\nsystems for medical diagnostics, implantable devices for health monitoring and drug delivery, and\ninformation systems to improve healthcare delivery. To meet the challenge of cybersecurity, EEs and\nCPEs design hardware and software for cryptographic algorithms and develop methods to ensure private\ncommunications through the Internet and wireless devices. They design new devices and systems for\nhigh-performance computing and networking. They build satellites and instruments to improve\ncommunications and enhance our knowledge of space and the Earth. And, EEs and CPEs enhance our\nleisure time by creating new ways to listen to music, watch movies, play games, communicate with\nfriends, and build social networks.\nStudents in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering learn from faculty who work\nat the cutting-edge of engineering research and bring the excitement of their discoveries to the\nclassroom. Engineers want to make things that work. EE and CPE students get hands-on opportunities to\nbuild components and systems from the beginning of their studies. In the freshman year, students explore\napplications of electrical and computer engineering, such as medical imaging and cryptography. In the\nsophomore year, EE and CPE students use personal, portable equipment and components to build and\nexplore simple digital and analog electronic systems, which become more complex each semester.\nLaboratories and team projects throughout the curriculum contribute to an enriching hands-on, minds-on\nlearning experience. By their senior year, students have the option of participating in a team-based,\nindustry-sponsored design project that spans two semesters in which they solve real-world engineering\nproblems while learning project management and team-building skills.\nElectrical engineering and computer engineering are dynamic and fast changing fields that driveinnovation and solutions to global challenges. The ECE faculty has created a program of study that\nprovides each graduate with a firm foundation in mathematics, physics, and engineering principles, and\nwith broad experience in different areas of EE and CPE. The program enables our graduates to excel in\ntheir EE and CPE specialties, while gaining the tools to adapt to the technical changes and career\nopportunities they will experience in the future. EE and CPE students develop effective communication\nand teamwork skills and gain knowledge of ethics, all of which are essential to professional success. EE\nand CPE graduates are prepared to pursue careers in industry and government, advanced graduate work\nin EE and CPE, and other advanced professional degrees.\nECE seeks to develop tomorrow's engineering and technical leaders and innovators. Students can\nenhance their undergraduate experience by participating in multidisciplinary team projects, cooperative\neducation and internships, research experiences for undergraduates, study abroad programs, dual degree\nand minor programs in other fields, and mentoring programs. The Cooperative Education (co-op) and\nInternship Program is highly recommended, as is participation in professional societies, including the\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) and the Association for\nComputing Machinery (ACM). ECE works with the Ted and Karyn Hume Center for National Security and\nTechnology to develop future leaders for the US government. ECE offers many scholarships for academic\nexcellence, leadership and service, as well as for participation in various special academic programs.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula.

Through EngE courses, first-year students participate in problem solving, engineering analysis\nand design exercises that represent the essence of the engineering profession. The courses emphasize team-\nbased, design-oriented, hands-on experiences to develop students' concepts of engineering and engineering\nmethods, while reinforcing the role of concurrent required courses (e.g. mathematics, English, physics). They\nalso serve as a foundation for subsequent courses in the various engineering curricula. Coverage of\nengineering ethics instills a sense of the responsibilities of engineers to society. Algorithm development and\ncomputer programming develop logical thinking, provide the background for computer use in later courses,\nand support problem-solving skills. Spatial visualization skills are developed through engineering graphics, a\nprimary engineering tool. Through writing and presentations, students begin to hone their professional\ncommunication skills, including audience analysis, visual rhetoric, effective writing styles, issues in\ncollaborative writing, techniques of oral presentation, print and Web-based research, graphics for written and\noral presentations, and editing.\nAll College of Engineering students must own 1) a convertible tablet PC or laptop running Windows 10\nmeeting current specifications, and 2) stipulated software used to analyze and solve problems in and out of\nclass. Computer requirements for engineering students can be located at www.eng.vt.edu/it/requirement.\nProcess for Declaring a Degree-Granting Engineering Major\nEntering students are admitted to General Engineering, the first-year program for all engineering curricula.\nThe program introduces students to foundational concepts and practices in engineering, allows time to adjust\nto the College, and provides opportunities to investigate the College's individual degree programs and select\nthe branch of engineering or computer science best suited to their skills and interests. At the end of the year -\nafter academic advising, contacts with the various departments, and satisfactory progress - students select a\ndegree program and, if academically eligible, are transferred to the appropriate degree-granting department.\nEntry into a degree-granting engineering department requires that students successfully complete all required\nfirst-year courses. Students must also earn a minimum grade of C- in ENGE 1215 and 1216 required before\ntransferring into a degree-granting engineering department.\nPlease see the College of Engineering catalog section titled \"Required Academic Progress\" for details, and\nvisit https://enge.vt.edu/undergraduate/Undergraduate_changing_major.html for application policies and\ndates.\nTypical First Semester\nCHEM 1035: General Chemistry (3)\nCHEM 1045: General Chemistry Lab (1)\nENGE 1215: Foundations of Engineering (C-) (2)\nENGL 1105: First-Year Writing (3)\nMATH 1225: Calculus of a Single Variable (4)\nTypical Second Semester\nENGE 1216: Foundations of Engineering (C-) (2)\nENGL 1106: First-Year Writing (3)\nMATH 1226: Calculus of a Single Variable (4)\nPHYS 2305: Foundations of Physics I (4)\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (ENGE)1014: ENGINEERING SUCCESS SEMINAR\nIntroduction to opportunities and resources available to College of Engineering students during their\nundergraduate career at VT.

A degree in English will\nappeal to students who are interested in a foundational education in the liberal arts, specializing in\nliterature and writing, and who may pursue careers in business, government, education, law, speech\nsciences, writing, publishing, advertising, health, activism, the arts, or social services.\nThe Department of English also offers minors in Literature, Language Sciences, Professional and\nTechnical Writing, and Creative Writing, and many of its courses provide credits for Pathways general\neducation in Discourse, Critical Thinking in the Humanities, Critique and Practice in Design and the Arts,\nand Critical Analysis of Equity and Identity in the U.S.\nEnglish Degree Majors\nStudents working towards the B.A. in English may choose from three majors, each consisting of 39\nrequired hours.\nA major in English\nWithin the English major, there are three options available to students: Literature, Pre-Education,\nand Pre-Law.\nA major in Professional and Technical Writing.\nA major in Creative Writing.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". Students must satisfactorily\ncomplete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nAll three of the majors share a common English core that provides a foundational curriculum in research,\ncritical thinking, and interpretation. Students in all three majors take these core courses together,\nproviding a rich and diverse context for the study of writing and literature. The core requirements and\nspecific major requirements can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar\nwebsite at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet\nminimum criteria toward the General Education requirements (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see\n\"Academics\") and toward the degree in English.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. in English can be found on the major checksheet by\nvisiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nPost Graduate StudyUndergraduate majors interested in pursuing advanced degrees (M.A., M.F.A., or Ph.D.) in English\nshould, with the assistance of their professors, mentors, and the department's academic advisor, carefully\nplan their programs of study. Coverage across periods and genres is strongly recommended, as is a\ngood reading knowledge of another language, for students planning to continue study for a master's or\ndoctoral degree. Getting to know professors and learning as much as possible about the professional\nelements of the discipline provide excellent preparation for graduate work.\nPathways General Education and English\nPathways General Education requires a six hours of foundational Discourse credits and three hours of\nadvanced or applied Discourse credits. English 1105 and 1106 fulfill the six foundational credits of this\nPathways requirement. These courses share a focus on the rhetorical dimensions of writing, speaking,\nand visual communication. Many 2000-4000 level ENGL courses fulfill the advanced or applied\nDiscourse credits, and can count toward students' majors and Pathways general education. The same is\ntrue of most courses that fulfill Critical Thinking in the Humanities, Reasoning in the Social Sciences,\nCritique and Practice in Design and the Arts, and Critical Analysis of Identity and Equity in the U.S.;\ncourses that meet one or more of these requirements can count for Pathways and major credit.\nAdvanced Standing (AS): Some students are exempted from ENGL 1105 and granted Advanced\nStanding on the basis of three scores: SAT Critical Reading, SAT Writing, and Standardized High School\nClass Rank. Advanced Standing students fulfill their Freshman English requirement with ENGL 1106. If\nAdvanced Standing students complete the assigned advanced course at Virginia Tech with a C- they\nreceive pass/fail credit for ENGL 1105, the course from which they are exempted. Advanced Standing is\na placement category for students at Virginia Tech; it is not related to the Advanced Placement (AP)\ncourses offered in high schools or the AP exam offered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).\nCredit from AP, CLEP, and IB exams can fulfill the CLE Area 1 requirement.

J. Eick (231-8943; eick@vt.edu)\nWeb: www.cses.vt.edu/undergraduate-programs/ensc/index.html\nOverview\nThis program brings the basic sciences to bear on many crucial concerns about the environment. The\nenvironments of particular interest are terrestrial and wetland ecosystems and associated land and water\nresources. Specific concerns include environmental protection, pollution prevention and remediation,\nland-use planning, waste management, ground- and surface-water quality, reclamation and remediation\nof disturbed or contaminated sites, and minimizing human impacts on the environment.\nThe Environmental Science curriculum is multidisciplinary and strongly science and technology oriented.\nThe curriculum prepares graduates for immediate entry into environmental careers as well as for\ngraduate specializations. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that employment of environmental\nscientists and specialists is projected to grow 11 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for\nall occupations.\nDegree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nRequirements for a Minor\nThe Environmental Science program also offers a minor. The requirements include CSES/ENSC 3114\nplus 3124 (or CSES/ENSC 3134) and CSES/ENSC 3604 and 14 to 15 more hours selected from a set of\n23 courses. See www.cses.vt.edu/undergraduate-programs/ensc/index.html or visit 240 Smyth Hall\nfor more information about a minor in environmental science.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet\nminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\")\nand toward the degree.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the specific degree can be found on the major checksheet by\nvisiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nOpportunities to Excel\nStudents with outstanding records can qualify for the Honors Program and graduate \"in honors\" in\nenvironmental science.

Money\nis a critical component of the economic system and its flow is the sustaining force of the U.S. and global\neconomy. Therefore, in working with how governments, corporations, intermediaries, and households\nutilize their financial assets finance professionals are an integral part of how the economy perpetuates the\nstandard of living that we enjoy.\nTraditionally there are three separate but related fields within finance: 1) corporate financial management\nor \"business finance\" which focuses on the internal decisions of companies to raise funds and invest in\ncorporate assets; 2) investment management which focuses on the purchase and sale of stocks and\nbonds or their derivatives by individuals and institutions; and 3) financial services management, which\nfocuses on the management and regulation of institutions and the role that financial institutions play in the\neconomy.\nThe undergraduate program in Finance meets the requirements of students who desire specialized\ncareers in financial management. Students gain expertise in both accounting and finance, essential for\nsuccess as a financial professional. The case-oriented focus of coursework requires students to apply\ntheir knowledge and strengthen their oral and written communication skills. The department offers\nspecializations in (i) Corporate Financial Management, (ii) Investment Management and CFA\u00a9 (Chartered\nFinancial Analyst), based on the CFA\u00a9 curriculum as recognized and approved by the CFA Institute, (iii)\nBanking and Financial Institutions Management, (iv) Financial Accounting, and (v) CFP\u00a9 Certification\nEducation with approval of CFP Board of Standards. Students also have the opportunity to participate in\nstudent management funds focused on investments in bonds (BASIS) and in stocks (SEED).\nThe curriculum offers courses in finance, insurance, and business law, but a major only in finance.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nStudents select different combinations of elective courses to fulfill the requirements of one or more of the\nsix options offered. The six options are: (i) Corporate Financial Management, (ii) Investment Management\nand CFA\u00a9 (Chartered Financial Analyst), (iii) Banking and Financial Institutions Management, (iv)\nFinancial Accounting, and (v) CFP\u00a9 Certification Education with approval of CFP Board of Standards\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (FIN)\n2104 (AAEC 2104): PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING\nSurvey of fundamental personal financial planning needs and decisions of young professionals.\nIntroduction to the personal financial planning needs that special household circumstances or non-\ntraditional household situations may precipitate.

Deisinger\nWeb: www.geography.vt.edu\nOverview\nGeography offers a unique perspective on many of today's most important issues--from globalization,\ninternational development, and culture change to environmental problems, population growth, and climate\nchange. Its theories and methods provide analytical techniques applicable to a wide range of questions\nsignificant to a broad spectrum of occupations. The geography major provides a balance between an\neducation focusing on contemporary social, political, economic, and environmental issues and training in\nadvanced computer-based techniques.\nHuman geography is concerned with the spatial dimensions of human existence, the economy, politics,\nand culture as well as the relationshsips between humans and their environments.\nPhysical geographers study patterns of climate, landforms, vegetation, soils, water, and natural hazardsand particularly the processes that produce those patterns, including human-environment interactions.\nGeospatial science involves Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS),\nweb services, and remote sensing. These technologies have led to significant advances in the ways in\nwhich geographic information is collected, mapped, analyzed, and integrated in database and decision-\nmaking systems. All students are exposed to these technologies as they are integral to working in the\nfield today regardless of specialization and topic of interest.\nTraining in geography provides valuable, marketable skills that are in high demand in business,\ngovernment, and education. Geography majors obtain employment in such diverse fields as geographic\ninformation systems, satellite imagery analysis, planning, transportation, market analysis, health care\nanalysis, cartography (map making), land and water management, recreation, and environmental\nconservation. Our students and graduates have worked with county, state, and federal agencies, privte\nfirms, non-profit organizations, and international organizations. Employment opportunities are especially\nstrong for students obtaining advanced training in geospatial computer techniques, which are used by\nboth human and physical geographers.\nGeography Major Degree Requirements\nThe department offers courses in human geography, physical geography, and geospatial information\nscience. In addition to fulfilling the requirements of the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal\nEducation), geography majors must also complete 48 hours in geography and related disciplines.

Watts\nWeb: www.geos.vt.edu\nE-mail: geosciences@vt.eduOverview\nGeosciences offer exciting opportunities for students with an interest in applying a full range of science\nand mathematical skills to understand the earth's properties and dynamic processes. This is a highly\ninterdisciplinary program that applies physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics to understand and\nmanage all aspects of Earth and the environment. Geoscientists work everywhere in the world under\nalmost any condition as they search for earth resources, manage the environment and natural hazards,\nand supervise technical and business enterprises. For more information about exciting careers in\nGeosciences consult http://about.agu.org/ and www.agiweb.org/careers.html. The extensive scientific\nand mathematical skills of geoscientists, along with their broad field experience, allow them to pursue\ncareers in many related fields ranging from material science to technical management to scientific\nreporting.\nThe internationally recognized faculty in Geosciences has developed four challenging options, described\nbelow, that lead to a B.S. in Geosciences. Coursework emphasizes the acquisition and processing of field\ndata beginning with a special course in field methods taken in the spring of the first year. The geology\noption requires, and the other options recommend, that the student participate in a six-week field camp.\nThe B.S. in Geosciences provides pre-professional preparation that will allow students to continue their\neducation in post graduate programs in science, law, and business.\nEarth systems and processes are enormously complicated and require a full range of intellectual skills to\ndecipher and manage. Geoscientists must possess good quantitative skills and a solid understanding of\nphysics, chemistry, and biology. They must be able to read maps, identify rocks, minerals, and fossils as\nwell as visualize earth structures in three dimensions. They must have strong communication skills, both\nwritten and verbal. Learning to use these skills in an integrated way is a challenging and rewarding\nexperience.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nGeology Option\nThe Geology option offers a detailed coverage of the broad range of classic disciplines within the\ngeosciences. This option emphasizes the study of minerals, rocks and fossils, and teaches the student\nhow to understand the processes and history of the earth based on the occurrences and relationships of\nthese materials at or near the Earth's surface.\nGeochemistry Option\nThe Geochemistry option is designed for those students who have special interest in the chemical\naspects of the Earth and its materials.Geophysics Option\nThe Geophysics option offers the student the opportunity to specialize in the branch of the geosciences\nthat investigates physical earth processes such as earthquakes and that images the interior of the earth\nthrough surface-based physical measurements.\nEarth Science Education Option\nThe Earth Science education option provides students with a broad earth science curriculum that meets\nthe content goals for secondary earth science teaching. Certification for Earth science teaching is not\nprovided in the program. Information about teaching certification in Virginia can be obtained from the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning.\nMinor in Geosciences\nThe requirements to earn a minor in Geosciences can be found on its checksheet by visiting the\nUniversity Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nGraduate Program\nThe department offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in geosciences with specializations in many sub-\ndisciplines. (See the Graduate Catalog for further information.)\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet\nminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\")\nand toward the degree.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the B.S. in Geosciences with any of the available options can\nbe found on the specific major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at\nhttp://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (GEOS)\n1004: EARTH SCIENCE: OUR PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE\nIntroduction to Earth science, including the fundamental concepts of geology in the modern context of\nhumans interacting with the Earth.

    "Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise": "Overview\nDietetics\nScience of Food, Nutrition, and Exercise\nSatisfactory Progress\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (HNFE)\nHead: Matthew W. Hulver\nProfessors: B. Davy, K. Davy, D. Liu, J. Rankin, E.L. Serrano, and J. Williams\nAssociate Professors: D. Brown, D.J. Good, R.W. Grange, M. Hulver, E.M. Schmelz, and\nY.H. Ju\nAssistant Professors: Z. Cheng, M. Frisard, S. Harden, V. Hedrick, V. Kraak, R.\nMcMillian, and C. Rafie\nSenior Instructor: C.B. Papillon\nAdvanced Instructor: H. Cox, R. Eaton, and N. Girmes-Grieco\nInstructors: K. Chang and M. Rockwell\nAdjunct Instructors: J. Gustafson, P. Ray, and W. Zuti\nWeb: www.hnfe.vt.eduOverview\nNutrition, foods, and exercise science is a unique field of study that builds on the biological and physical\nsciences. Human nutrition is directed toward helping people choose food that meets their physiological\nneeds and is consistent with their lifestyles and cultural preferences. Changes in lifestyle and food\nconsumption patterns have created consumer demand for new food products that are shelf stable, require\nlittle or no preparation, and are appropriate in nutrition content. These trends have increased the need for\nfood professionals who wish to apply their science background to exploring the nutrient content and\nchemical and physical properties of foods and food ingredients. Increasing interest in physical fitness and\nwellness has brought about new professional opportunities in assisting people who want to develop\nappropriate exercise patterns and make healthy changes in their lifestyle.\nMany contemporary health issues including obesity, heart disease, and cancer have been associated with\na person's food intake and level of exercise. This has led to increasing emphasis on health promotion and\ndisease intervention, and the nutrition and exercise professionals are integral members of the health care\nteam. Expanding research by private and government agencies focusing on the role of nutrition and\nphysical activity in health, growth, and aging has created a demand for graduates at the B.S., M.S., and\nPh.D. levels who have a background and interest in laboratory and experimental methods in nutrition,\nfoods and exercise science. The current interest in physical performance in our society has broadened\nthe opportunities for combining expertise in nutrition with exercise and fitness for those with skills in\ncounseling and entrepreneurship. Individuals with a background in food and nutrition are needed to help\nsolve the problems of world hunger and food shortages, and the accompanying loss of human potential.\nThere are two options from which an undergraduate student majoring in human nutrition, foods and\nexercise may choose: Dietetics or Science of Food, Nutrition and Exercise.\nThe department participates in the University's Honors Program (see \"Academics\" in this catalog).\nThe Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise at Virginia Tech offers Master's and Doctoral\ndegrees in three specialized areas as they relate to nutrition, physical activity, and health. Graduate\nstudents may earn a M.S. or a Ph.D. with an emphasis in Molecular and Cellular Science, Clinical\nPhysiology and Metabolism, or Behavioral and Community Science.\nDegree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nDietetics\nConsult: Heather K. Cox\nThe undergraduate Dietetics option, known as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD), leads to a\nBachelor of Science degree in Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise. The dietetics option fulfills all\nacademic course requirements for a Didactic Program in Dietetics according to the Standards of\nEducation per the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). ACEND is the\naccrediting arm of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Following completion of the B.S. degree, a\nstudent has earned an ACEND Verification Statement. A student must then complete a supervised\npractice program (Dietetic Internship) to be eligible for the Registration Examination (RD) for Dietitians.\nThe supervised practice requirement can be met through any ACEND accredited dietetic internship.\nGraduates with the B.S. in Dietetics are eligible to apply for the department's, or other, accredited Dietetic\nInternships.\nRegistered Dietitians work in a variety of work settings. The dietetics program prepares you to assume a\nprofessional role in health care, research, the business environment or to pursue graduate studies. The\ndietetics program ultimately prepares you to assume a professional role in a health care, research, or\nbusiness setting or to go on to graduate school. Clinical dietitians in hospitals and out-patient clinics\nprovide care to individuals with disease-related nutritional problems. Community dietitians may work in\nhealth clubs specializing in sports nutrition, in work site wellness programs, or in community programs\nserving mothers and children, low-income families, or elderly people. Others work for food companies\ndealing with consumer questions about the nutrient content of food products, or with companies\nmanufacturing nutritional supplements or other medical or health products. Administrative Dietitians with\nmanagement or business interests find positions in food service management in health care facilities,\nwork site, college, or university food service, or hotels and resorts. Registered Dietitians counsel people\nof all ages, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and levels of education.\nStudents in the Dietetics option must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 to remain in this option. Students\nwho want to change their major into the Dietetics option with HNFE must have an overall GPA of 3.0.\nPlease see the Satisfactory Progress section for additional requirements.\nScience of Food, Nutrition, and Exercise\nConsult: Renee Eaton\nUpon completion of this option a student is well prepared for graduate work in any area of nutrition,\nexercise physiology or related sciences. This option also meets most admission requirements for\nmedical, dental, physical therapy, pharmacy, physician assistant, athletic training and other health\nprofessions programs. This option allows students flexibility to tailor the degree toward long term goals\nwhich may lead to employment opportunities in research and development with a company manufacturing\nnutritional, health and exercise, or medical products, in the food industry in food product testing or quality\ncontrol, in the health and fitness industry, or in a position related to clinical exercise physiology. Students\nin this option gain knowledge, skills, and abilities specified by the American College of Sports Medicinefor certification as a Certified Health Fitness Specialist. With the growing attention to the role of nutrition\nand exercise in health promotion and disease prevention, this option is especially appropriate for the\nstudent preparing for a career in medicine, physical therapy, or a related health field.

They are trained to\nprepare clear and concise recommendations through drawings, models and verbal descriptions.\nIndustrial design services are often provided within the context of cooperative working relationships with\nother members of a development group. Typical groups include management, marketing, engineering and\nmanufacturing specialists. The industrial designer expresses concepts that embody all relevant design\ncriteria determined by the group.The industrial designer's unique contribution places emphasis on those aspects of the product or system\nthat relate most directly to human characteristics, needs and interests. This contribution requires\nspecialized understanding of visual, tactile, safety and convenience criteria, with concern for the user.\nEducation and experience in anticipating psychological, physiological and sociological factors that\ninfluence and are perceived by the user are essential industrial design resources.\"\nThe internationally recognized program at Virginia Tech, fully accredited by the National Association of\nSchools of Art and Design, prepares individuals to enter this dynamic field through a rigorous curriculum\nand an experienced, dedicated faculty.\nProgram Requirements\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

In an environment that fosters leadership, achievement,\nand diversity, we:\nPrepare undergraduate and graduate students for life-long success and leadership in the\nprofession, in industry, and in higher education;\nConduct and disseminate research that promotes the economic prosperity and well-being of Virginia\nand the nation; and\nProvide valuable services to industry, society, and the ISE profession.\nIndustrial and systems engineering is one of the most diverse fields in engineering. ISE is concerned with\nthe design, improvement, and installation of integrated work systems of people, materials, equipment and\ntechnology, processes, information, and capital. The industrial engineer is concerned with creating value\nand improving performance of integrated systems, whether that involves improving quality and\nproductivity, reducing costs and non-value adding activities, improving customer satisfaction, or improving\nworker safety.\nThe applications for industrial engineering capabilities include industry, government, and service\norganizations. Graduates of the ISE program at Virginia Tech work in manufacturing facilities, distribution\nwarehouses, hospitals, airlines, railroads, banks, amusement parks, the military, federal government, and\nmanagement consulting firms. The boundaries of where IEs make contributions are limitless.\nThe mission of the ISE Undergraduate Program is to prepare industrial and systems engineering students\nto create value for organizations, the profession, and society. We achieve this mission by recruiting,\nretaining, and educating high quality and diverse students and by creating a rigorous and collegial\nenvironment enabling students to learn industrial engineering methods and tools, built upon a foundation\nof mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences, and to apply them in any global organizational\nsetting. Students are able to achieve academic and professional success through opportunities to\nparticipate in various educational experiences, to develop capabilities as future leaders, and to embark on\na lifelong journey of professional development and learning.\nProgram Educational Objectives and Student Outcomes\nThe ISE faculty, with input from our external Advisory Board, employers, and students, have defined the\nfollowing Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) and Student Outcomes for our Undergraduate\nProgram. PEOs are statements that describe the expected accomplishments of ISE graduates within 3-5\nyears after graduation. Student Outcomes are statements that describe what students are expected to\nknow and be able to do at the time of graduation.\nProgram Educational Objectives: Within 3-5 years of graduation, ISE alumni will have:\nCreated value by applying the appropriate industrial and systems engineering tools to\ndesign/redesign integrated systems/processes, solve problems, implement innovative solutions, and\nimprove organizational outcomes.\nProvided formal and informal project, administrative, or technical leadership.\nPursued professional development through graduate study, professional certification, or continuing\neducation.\nCommunicated effectively using written, oral, and visual media adapted to different audiences andstakeholders.\nWorked effectively in cross-functional team environments comprised of members with varying\norganizational backgrounds, positions, and geographic locations.\nServed the profession, community, and society as exemplified in our motto Ut Prosim.\nStudent Outcomes: At the time of graduation, ISE students will have:\nAbility to apply computational and industrial engineering tools and techniques encompassing\nmanufacturing systems, operations research, human factors and ergonomics, and management\nsystems.\nAbility to apply knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and physical and social sciences to IE\nproblems.\nAbility to identify, formulate, and solve structured and unstructured IE problems.\nAbility to model, analyze, and evaluate work systems and processes, using appropriate\nexperimental design, measurement tools/techniques, and data.\nAbility to generate and evaluate alternatives to design an integrated work system or process\nthrough a systems perspective.\nAbility to evaluate the impact of IE solutions in the broader context of the organization and society,\nwith an appreciation of different cultures and perspectives.\nKnowledge of the role of industrial engineers in contemporary issues.\nAbility to communicate effectively to a variety of audiences and using written, oral, and visual\nmedia.\nUnderstanding of professionalism, good citizenship, and ethical behavior.\nAbility to work collaboratively in multi-disciplinary teams.\nUnderstanding of the need for continued professional development and ability to engage in life-long\nlearning.\nThe Industrial and Systems Engineering program at Virginia Tech is accredited by the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.\nCurriculum\nThe ISE curriculum explicitly encompasses coursework useful in addressing not only the technical\nelements of work systems, but also the organizational, economic, and human elements. Our aim is to\nprovide graduates with the knowledge and capabilities to enable them to successfully pursue careers in\nindustrial engineering or, if qualified, to continue on to graduate study.\nISE emphasizes instruction in fundamental engineering principles based on the physical sciences,\nengineering sciences, mathematics, and statistics. These principles are applied in practical design\nexperiences throughout the undergraduate curriculum.\nCourse work in the physical and chemical sciences and mathematics provides a solid background for\nbasic engineering science courses, which in turn support more focused courses in industrial engineering,\ncovering topics in operations research, manufacturing systems engineering, human factors engineering\nand ergonomics, and management systems engineering. In all these areas, analysis and design activities\nare supported by modern computing and software tools taught in the curriculum.\nStudents gain valuable hands-on experience in multiple areas of our curriculum in state-of-the-art\nlaboratory facilities associated with the undergraduate program. These include the ISE Computer\nLaboratory, which contains computers and printers to support the needs and requirements of ISE\nstudents that are not available through access to personal computers or in other laboratories; the Senior\nDesign Center, with computer support and other resource material for student design projects; the Harris\nManufacturing Processes Laboratories, which contain robotics and automation equipment, machining\nequipment, conventional and numerically controlled machine tools, and welding and foundry facilities; the\nHuman Factors Work Measurement and Methods Engineering Laboratory, which is equipped and usedfor in-class exercises and experiments in work measurement, motion economy and time study,\npsychophysics, human audition and vision, and work station design. Students also have the opportunity\nto work on Undergraduate Research with faculty and graduate students in the many ISE research labs\nand groups.\nThe capstone course in the ISE Undergraduate Program is a two-semester class, ISE 4005-6 Project\nManagement & System Design (also referred to as \"Senior Design\"), where students work in project\nteams with an external company sponsor to solve a real-world problem. This experience provides ISE\nstudents with actual project experience that develops technical and professional skills, such as teamwork,\ncommunication, project management, and life-long learning skills, in addition to developing capabilities in\napplying IE tools and techniques. Student project teams present their project findings at our annual\nSenior Design Symposium attended by company sponsors and the ISE Advisory Board.\nFor the 2019 graduation requirements, the course work totals 133 hours. Electives provide students with\nthe opportunity to explore other areas of engineering, as well as cultural, societal and creative\nexperiences, which makes for a well-rounded, diverse, and globally-aware engineer.\nThe ISE program also provides students with the opportunity to pursue minors, such as a Business Minor,\nGreen Engineering Minor, or Statistics Minor. More specific information about minors available to ISE\nstudents can be found in the ISE Undergraduate Student Handbook, posted on the ISE web site.\nStudents and employers alike are seeing the benefits of these minors for adding value to the ISE major.\nMany ISE students seek to participate in Undergraduate Research to satisfy elective requirements in the\ncurriculum. The opportunity to work more closely, in some cases on a one-on-one basis, with our\noutstanding faculty can provide more in-depth development of ISE capabilities and a more enriching\neducational experience.\nThe department participates in the Cooperative Education & Internship Program, in which qualified\nstudents may alternate semesters of study with semesters of professional co-op employment or\ninternships. Students are encouraged to pursue these experiences before they graduate to make them\nmore competitive in the work force. Students are also encouraged to participate in career fairs and job\ninterviews on and off campus.\nThe ISE department also provides students with many significant scholarship opportunities at the\nundergraduate and graduate levels to encourage and acknowledge high academic performance and\nachievements. The ISE department also maintains bilateral student exchange agreements with\ninternational universities, where students can take ISE courses which will transfer back to their BSISE.\nStudents may also select other universities at which to perform a study abroad semester.\nGraduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. are offered (see Graduate Catalog). The graduate\nprograms include concentrations in manufacturing systems engineering, human factors engineering and\nergonomics, operations research, management systems engineering, and general IE. The ISE\nDepartment also coordinates on- and off-campus master's degree programs in systems engineering\n(M.S.) and engineering administration (M.E.A.).\nProgram Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Graduation\nrequirements are referred to via university publications known as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit\nhours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at https://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to meet with one of the ISE Academic Advisors to discuss the BSISE\ncurriculum.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (ISE)\n2004: INTRODUCTION TO INDUSTRIAL AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING\nIntroduction to the industrial and systems engineering profession through exposure to problems,\nprinciples, and practice.

Renard, and B. Whitney\nAssistant Professors: M. Wagner and E. Tural\nAssociate Professor Emeritus: B. Parsons\nWeb: www.archdesign.vt.edu/interior-design/\nOverview\nThe interior design program at Virginia Tech is dedicated to improving quality of life through design\nexcellence, professionalism, and public service. With a curriculum that equally respects the importance of\ncreative skill, history, building technology, ethics, innovation, and business practice, our graduates have\nthe ability and confidence needed to immediately contribute to the profession.\nStudents in the interior program begin their studies in the foundation design laboratory during the first two\nsemesters with architecture, landscape architecture and industrial design students. From the beginning,\nboth an independent and team approach to design solutions is encouraged.\nIn their professional studies students are challenged to think critically in their design of space and to\ndevelop solutions that not only enhance quality of life, but also protect the health, safety, and welfare of\nusers as prescribed in the various codes and regulations that govern the work of interior designers. This\nphilosophy is the core of our program. It establishes a foundation upon which each student graduateswith creative ingenuity and professional responsibility.\nOur CIDA accredited program prepares future designers for licensure and practice. A degree from a CIDA\naccredited program is increasingly important as a requirement for professional certification and licensing\nof Interior Designers in the United States. Graduating from a CIDA accredited program is the first step in\na three-part process in achieving certification or licensing as an interior designer in various states. The\nlast two steps are to complete two years of assistantship as an interior designer and then passing the\nNational Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) examination. A CIDA accredited degree, work\nexperience and passing the NCIDQ exam satisfy the requirements in Virginia for recognition as a\n\"Certified Interior Designer.\"\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation.

Hays, D. Hill, and B. Johnson\nProfessor Emeritus: B. Johnson\nWeb: www.lar.vt.eduOverview\nLandscape Architecture encompasses the design, analysis, planning, management, and stewardship of\nsustainable environments. Landscape architects design across a wide spectrum of projects: parks and\ngardens, community design, urban design and planning, green infrastructure, and regional planning, as well as\nat the scale of watersheds and natural systems. The work of the profession is grounded in the natural and\nsocial sciences, draws inspiration from nature and the arts, and is implemented through innovative design, site\nengineering, construction, land management, and environmental technologies. The Landscape Architecture\nProgram guides students as they address some of the most important challenges of our time: climate change;\nhealthy living and empathetic design; urbanization; re-imagining water, food, energy and transportation; green\ninfrastructure; remediation of spoiled and disturbed sites; and preserving critical natural resources. We believe\nthe work of the profession, at the critical intersection of natural and cultural systems, will be the most\nconsequential of the design arts in the 21st century.\nThe core of the academic program is a rigorous sequence of design studios that allows students to explore a\nbroad range of landscape architectural issues, contexts, and project types. Studios are accompanied by\ndiscussion, lecture, and laboratory courses that provide systematic and comprehensive coverage of the\nemerging body of knowledge related to technology, design theory, landscape ecology, and human/environment\ninteraction. Off-campus options include a summer travel studio, study at the Washington Alexandria\nArchitecture Center, and exchange programs with Tongji University in Shanghai, or University College, Dublin,\nIreland, as well as an independent semester abroad and professional internships.\nThe Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (B.L.A.) is a five year first-professional degree program fully\naccredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board of the American Society of Landscape\nArchitects. Graduates have a wide range of employment and professional opportunities including work in\nprivate practice, multidisciplinary firms, public agencies and municipalities, non-government organizations and\nnon-profits.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required\nfor degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and\nuniversity obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not\nalter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition\nplan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for\ndegree requirements.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum\ncriteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the\ndegree in Landscape Architecture. Landscape Architecture majors must attain a C- or better in their studio\ncourses and the technology courses to advance to the next courses in these sequences.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the degree can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the\nUniversity Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (LAR)\n1144: INTRODUCTION TO LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE\nOverview of the profession of landscape architecture.

Zietsman\nScholarship Chair: J. Kim\nWeb: www.math.vt.edu\nOverview\nMathematics is essential to a clear and complete understanding of virtually all phenomena. Its precision,\ndepth, and generality support the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The study of\nmathematics provides the ability to describe applied problems quantitatively and to analyze these\nproblems in a precise and logical manner. This is a principal reason behind the strong demand for\nmathematicians in government and industry. Essentially all complex problems, whether physical, social, or\neconomic, are solved by designing a mathematical model, analyzing the model, and determining\ncomputational algorithms for an efficient and accurate approximation of a solution. Each of these phases\nis mathematical in nature. For example, if a problem deviates from a standard form, a mathematician\nshould be able to adjust the usual mathematical treatment of the problem to accommodate the deviation.\nIn this case mathematical training provides a practical preparation for a career in today's changing world.\nMoreover, it is especially valuable because it is an education that equips one to continue to adapt to new\nsituations.\nMathematicians typically are employed as applied mathematicians in their specialty areas. Our recent\nmathematics graduates have been approximately equally divided among government and industry,\ngraduate school, and teaching. There are four different paths or options that a student may follow\ntowards a B.S. in Mathematics: 1) the Traditional Option; 2) the Applied Computational Mathematics\nOption (ACM); 3) the Applied Discrete Mathematics Option (ADM); and 4) the Mathematics Education\nOption (MSTR).\nThe Traditional Option, as its name implies, yields a broad and flexible background in mathematics. The\nother three options are more specialized. The ACM option is designed for students primarily interested in\ncomputational mathematics and its applications to engineering and the natural and social sciences. The\nADM option is designed for students primarily interested in areas of applied mathematics closely\nassociated with computer science. The Mathematics Education Option is designed for students who want\nto be certified to teach secondary mathematics.\nOften students will begin their studies in the Traditional Option and later change to one of the other three\noptions when they become more sure of the path they wish to pursue. One, however, can acquire many\naspects of the three specialized options within the Traditional Option, because it also requires some\ndegree of specialization in an applications area and provides career development features. The three\nspecialized options are each less general, but bring particular career paths into sharper focus. Each of\nthe four options provides an excellent foundation for graduate study, either in mathematics or in an\napplications area. Handbooks for each of the options, as well as mathematics career information, are\navailable upon request.\nApproximately $45,000 in Hatcher, Morris, Layman, Rollins, Steeneck, Caldwell, Wells, Oehring, Eckert,\nPersinger, Kim, Kimball, and Roselle scholarships is awarded annually to mathematics majors at Virginia\nTech: $5,000 for incoming freshmen and $40,000 for continuing undergraduates. Information on the\nscholarships is available from the scholarship chairman in mathematics.The Cooperative Education Program is also available to qualified candidates, and students wishing to mix\npractical experience with their formal course studies are encouraged to investigate this option. For more\ninformation, contact Career Services at Virginia Tech.\nThe Mathematics Department firmly believes that mathematics is not only useful and beautiful, but also\nfun. The department sponsors student chapters of MAA (Mathematical Association of America), SIAM\n(Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics), Pi Mu Epsilon (the national mathematics honorary\nsociety), and AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics). As well as social activities, these groups\nsponsor speakers to talk on how mathematics is used in their work. Each fall, Virginia Tech also sponsors\nthe Virginia Tech Regional Mathematics Contest. In addition, students (not all of whom are mathematics\nmajors) annually receive organized preparation and compete in the nationwide William Lowell Putnam\nCompetition and the international Mathematical Contest in Modeling. Individual undergraduate research\nprojects are available to talented students, and a Layman Prize is awarded for the best research project.\nAn overall outstanding senior, as well as an outstanding senior for each option, is recognized each year.\nThe Honors Program in Mathematics provides outstanding undergraduate majors the opportunity for an\nenriched academic environment. Through honors courses, an honors project, individual association with\nthe faculty and honors advisors, and other perquisites, the honors student in mathematics enjoys a\nvaluable advantage in the undergraduate experience. Moreover, in coordination with the head of\nMathematics and the dean of Science, the honors student may design her/his own individual set of\ngraduation requirements.\nIn addition to the four undergraduate-degree options, the department also offers the M.S. and Ph.D.\nMoreover, for qualified students, a combined program is available that leads to both a B.S. and an M.S.\nin Mathematics. This program saves a year from the usual time required for a B.S. and an M.S. done\nseparately. Students in the Education Option obtain a B.S. in Math and an M.A. in Education by\ncompleting four years of undergraduate study and a fifth year in education for a full secondary\ncertification.\nThe minor is designed to provide recognition for those students who take a program of study in\nmathematics above the normal requirements of their disciplines.\nBachelor of Science in Mathematics\nRequirements\nNote that the Calculus curriculum is in transition and there are two possible paths through Calculus. We\ndistinguish the two paths as follows: Path 1 for students who have received credit for MATH 1205 prior to\nfall 2014 and Path 2 for students who have not received credit for MATH 1205 prior to fall 2014.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nThose courses listed in the catalog under the subtitles \"Basic Sequences for Students in Agriculture,\nArchitecture, Biology, Business, and Liberal Arts and Human Sciences\" and \"Electives (may not be taken\nby Mathematics Majors)\" may not be used for graduation in mathematics.

Rabe (Air Force Research\nLab), and B. Sanders (Air Force Research Lab)\nWeb: www.me.vt.edu\nNature of the Profession\nMechanical engineering is the broadest of the engineering professions. Because of the breadth of the ME\ndiscipline, mechanical engineers work in a wide variety of technical areas and are employed in a range of job\nfunctions. Specialty areas within the mechanical engineering discipline include, among many others, acoustics,\nbiomechanics, CAD, controls, energy conversion and energy management, HVAC, materials, mechanical\ndesign, mechatronics, nuclear engineering, robotics and automation, and turbomachinery. The actual job\nfunctions which mechanical engineers perform vary widely as well. ME's work in design, research and\ndevelopment, manufacturing, service and maintenance, as well as technical sales, in almost every industry.\nMany are in management and administration. Many mechanical engineering graduates go on to more\nadvanced degrees, or continue their education in other fields, such a law or business.\nEmployment Opportunities\nBecause of the diversity and breadth of the mechanical engineering profession, ME graduates find\nemployment in a wide variety of industries, laboratories, and consulting firms. This results in a relatively stable\njob market that is not dependent upon a single particular industry. The textile, petroleum, chemical, electronic,\nautomotive, aerospace, power generation, HVAC, and manufacturing industries hire large numbers of\nmechanical engineering graduates and the starting salaries for ME's are very competitive with the other\nengineering disciplines.\nBecause of the wide diversity of specialties and job functions any two mechanical engineers might have\nsignificantly different day-to-day activities and responsibilities. Some may be concerned with very large\nengineering systems while others are working with small and even microscale devices and components; some\nwork might call for highly analytical or mathematical approaches while other work might be more amenable to\nexperimental or empirical approaches. Mechanical engineers may be involved in the operation of processing\nplants, or the design of engines, prosthetic devices, steam and gas turbines or compressors and pumps,\nalternative fuel devices, and many other devices and systems. At Virginia Tech there is a close association\nbetween the ME departments research and design project activities with industry. This enhances the\nopportunities for student interaction with industry representatives.\nMechanical Engineering Program Educational Objectives\nWithin a few years after graduating from the Mechanical Engineering Department at Virginia Tech, the\ngraduates will attain:\nPositions where they utilize fundamental technical knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and\nengineering to analyze and solve problems, and apply these abilities to generate new knowledge, ideas\nor products in academia, industry or government.\nPractical experience and organizational skills, enabling them to interact and communicate effectively(written and/or oral) with others (e.g., supervisor, client and/or team) with regard to the diversity of the\nstakeholders involved in their work.\nRoles of increasing responsibility leading to leadership positions that benefit themselves, their employers\nand society.\nSkills in life-long learning through: (a) self-study, (b) continuing education/short courses or workshops,\nand/or (c) formal graduate level education, as well as skills to motivate and encourage co-workers to\nalso pursue lifelong learning.\nRoles in professional and personal life where they demonstrate professional and ethical responsibilities\ntoward peers, employers, and society and follow these precepts in their daily lives.\nProgram Outcomes\nWe expect our students to have the following skills, knowledge, and behaviors by the time of their graduation.\nWe want our students to obtain:\nAn ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of\nengineering, science, and mathematics.\nAn ability to apply the engineering design process to produce solutions that meet specified needs with\nconsideration for public health and safety, and global, cultural, social, environmental, economic, and\nother factors as appropriate to the discipline.\nAn ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use\nengineering judgment to draw conclusions.\nAn ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.\nAn ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make\ninformed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic,\nenvironmental, and societal contexts.\nAn ability to recognize the ongoing need to acquire new knowledge, to choose appropriate learning\nstrategies, and to apply this knowledge.\nAn ability to function effectively as a member or leader of a team that establishes goals, plans tasks,\nmeets deadlines, and creates a collaborative and inclusive environment.\nThe Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) degree program at Virginia Tech is accredited by\nthe Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.\nThe department is committed to providing students with an exceptional experience in both the theory and\npractice of mechanical engineering. In the senior capstone sequence students are required to apply classroom\nknowledge to complex engineering problems requiring teamwork, problem formulation, economic analysis,\neffective communication, and product realization. These projects are carefully selected and updated to ensure\nrelevancy to contemporary technical issues and needs. The department encourages the involvement of\nunderclassmen and students outside the department and college in these projects. The department also\nencourages hands-on student involvement by providing dedicated machine and welding shops that exclusively\nserve the undergraduate program. The required sophomore-level Manufacturing Processes Laboratory course\nand certification by a professional machinist are required prior to use of either of these shops. Opportunity for\nprofessional development is provided by participation in student professional organizations, such as the\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME, and the American Nuclear Society, ANS.\nThe Curriculum\nA total of 131 semester credits are required for graduation. Please refer to the Registrar's website for official\nprogram checksheets showing the graduation requirements and recommended course plans. A revised ME\ncurriculum is currently in preparation. Students should check the ME website or speak with one of the ME\nundergraduate advisers for the latest information regarding the proposed curriculum changes. For the currently\napproved curriculum unofficial documents are available on the ME website showing prerequisite relationships\nto courses and alternative course plans (e.g. for co-op students and military 4.5 and 5-year plans).www.me.vt.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-program/current-students/course-\nselection/#requiredcourses\nThe ME curriculum provides a strong foundation in the basic physical and chemical sciences and in\nmathematics. These are followed by a sequence of courses that provide a broad background in design\nmethodology, computer programming, electronics, solid and fluid mechanics, manufacturing processes, system\nmodeling, machine design, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, statistics and materials. Courses in\nEnglish and in the humanities and social sciences are included to broaden the individual. This background is\nstrengthened and unified through a sequence of engineering design and laboratory courses. Instructional\nlaboratories in the junior and senior years provide opportunities for students to learn measurement and\ninstrumentation techniques. Students apply these skills to the acquisition and analysis of data from various\nengineering systems.\nIn all professional endeavors the mechanical engineer must consider ecological effects as well as the\neconomic and social needs of people. The mechanical engineer must consider the conservation of natural\nresources and the environmental impact in the design of systems. These considerations are included in a\nnumber of ME courses and technical elective classes. Students wishing to further strengthen this area may\nwish to consider the Green Engineering Option at www.eng.vt.edu/green/index.php.\nThe unifying activity in all aspects of mechanical engineering is the design function. A special emphasis has\nbeen placed on the use of computer-aided design methods and applied design project experience as a\nrequired part of the curriculum. Elective courses in the junior and senior years provide students with the\nopportunity to pursue specialized interests related to career plans or preparation for graduate study.\nThe department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may alternate\nsemesters of study with semesters of professional employment. Approximately twenty percent of all\nmechanical engineering students participate in this program.\nEducation Abroad Programs\nThe Department of Mechanical Engineering is a world leader in providing high-quality education abroad\nopportunities to its students and preparing them to function effectively as true global engineers. The\ncornerstone of this strategy is the Ultimate Global Engineer Program, which identifies three major windows of\nopportunity for students to attend topflight mechanical engineering programs abroad and graduate on time.\nStudents can select to participate in any combination of one, two, or even all three of these windows of\nopportunity:\nWindows #1: Fall semester sophomore year in a country where the language of instruction is English.\nCurrently students can attend the University of Melbourne, the top-ranked mechanical engineering program in\nAustralia.\nWindows #2: Rising junior summer in a country with a non-English language but where the language of\ninstruction is English. Currently students can attend Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the top-ranked mechanical\nengineering program in China. This program is particularly well suited for students that need to catch up on\ntheir course work, reduce their junior-year course load, or get ahead on their course work.\nWindows #3: Senior year abroad in a country with a non-English language but where the language of\ninstruction is non-English. Currently students can attend the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt (TUD), the top-\nranked mechanical engineering program in Germany. Language training is integrated into the curriculum,\nstarting as late as spring semester junior year.\nFor more information about these and other exiting education abroad programs offered by the Department of\nMechanical Engineering, please visit:\nhttp://www.me.vt.edu/international\nhttp://www.tud.vt.edu/BS\nEntrance RequirementThe College of Engineering at Virginia Tech limits the number of students who may transfer into any particular\ndepartment, with that number based upon the number of faculty in each separate department. Refer to the\nEngineering Education website at www.enge.vt.edu for the latest information on transferring into the ME\ndepartment. The ME academic advisor may also be consulted for information on anticipated entrance\nrequirement changes.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum\ncriteria toward the Curriculum for Liberal Education (recently replaced with Pathways General Education\nCurriculum), and toward the degree in mechanical engineering.\nSatisfactory progress toward a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering includes the following minimum criteria:\nComplete a minimum of 12 credits that apply toward the BSME each year\nmaintain an in-major GPA (all ME and NSEG courses) of at least a 2.0\nmaintain an extended in-major GPA of at least 2.0 (in all ME, NSEG courses plus ESM 2104, 2204, and\n2304).\ncomplete ESM 2104, Math 2114 and Math 2204 within 45 attempted required course credits (not to\ninclude CLE courses, technical electives or free electives)\ncomplete ESM 2304, ME 2124, and Math 2214 within 60 attempted required course credits (not to\ninclude CLE courses, technical electives, or free electives)\ncomplete ME 3124, ME 3514 and ME 3614 within 72 attempted required course credits (not to include\nCLE courses, technical electives, or free electives)\ncomplete ME 4006, ME 4015 and ME 4124 within 90 attempted required course credits (not to include\nCLE courses, technical electives, or free electives)\ncomplete any required course in the ME curriculum within two or feer attempts\nThe department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. in mechanical engineering\n(see the Graduate Catalog).\nThe Department of Mechanical Engineering actively seeks input on the nature and quality of our program from\nall interested individuals and organizations, including students, employers and supporting agencies. Our goal\nis to provide the best possible service to the students who entrust their education to us. Through our\ncontinuous improvement efforts, we pledge to continually improve the content of our curriculum, our\neducational methods and our facilities. Comments to the department head or any member of the faculty are\nwelcomed.

Driven by the needs and\nwants of the consumer, marketing managers develop new products, assign effective price levels, create\npromotional strategies, and develop the best distribution plans to guarantee that products reach the final\nconsumer. Marketing also plays a crucial role in managing the efficient flow of goods and services from\nbusinesses to businesses. And managing marketing is growing even more exciting as technology and the\ninternet enable managers to stay in closer contact with their customers and better manage this\nrelationship. Marketing by manufacturing firms is well-known. Service industries such as banking and\nhealth care, however, are increasingly relying on marketing to improve service quality and delivery. Non-\nprofit organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity and the American Red Cross, also use marketing to\ndeliver social goods and services. All of these organizations benefit when they are able to use marketing\nconcepts and tools to better understand their clients and design unique offerings that can meet their\nclients' needs.\nThe undergraduate program in marketing management is designed to offer the student a broad business\neducation with an emphasis on professional training for development of marketing strategies and\nmanaging marketing operations. Virginia Tech Marketing graduates pursue a range of careers. They take\njobs in marketing management, sales, advertising, retailing, and consulting positions in companies small\nand large. The curriculum is designed to provide core skills in marketing and to support this broad range\nof potential career interests.\nIn addition to the undergraduate program, the faculty in marketing management offer a master's and a\ndoctoral degree for those students interested in more technical positions, such as marketing research;\nmore rapid promotion with certain employers; or positions in higher education.\nThe department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may\nalternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment.\nThe Marketing Department currently offers three degree options: Marketing- no concentration, Marketing-\nSales concentration, and Marketing- Digital Marketing Strategy Concentration. In addition to the major,\nMarketing offers minors in Professional Sales and Digital Marketing Strategy to non-Marketing majors\nwithin the College of Business only.The Professional Sales concentration and minor provide students with the knowledge and skills\nnecessary to successfully enter the field of professional sales. Students will learn the necessary\nknowledge and skills needed to compete successfully in the respective field.\nThe Digital Marketing Strategy Concentration and minor provides students with the knowledge and skills\nto enter Marketing and related fields with technical experience in Digital Product delivery and developing,\nanalyzing, and enhancing firms' products on the web, mobile, and social networks.\nRequirements\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

These materials include ceramics,\nmetals, polymers, composites, biomaterials, nanomaterials, semiconductors, and electronic, magnetic, and\nphotonic materials. Materials engineers develop new materials, improve traditional materials, and manufacture\nmaterials economically through synthesis, processing, and fabrication. They seek to understand physical and\nchemical phenomena in material structures and to measure and characterize materials properties of all kinds\nincluding mechanical, electrical, optical, magnetic, thermal, and chemical. They predict and evaluate the\nperformance of materials as structural or functional elements in engineering systems and structures. They\nassist engineers in other disciplines and architects in selecting optimal materials for various applications.\nSignificant opportunities exist for graduates in the aerospace, automobile, transportation, medical,\nmicroelectronics, telecommunications, chemical, petroleum, energy storage, power generation, and energy\nconservation industries, as well as within the basic industries producing materials--for example, the copper,\naluminum, steel, ceramics, glass, and polymer industries. Opportunities also exist in government-operated\nengineering centers and research laboratories. Graduates work in entry level engineering, manufacturing,\nmaterials selection and design, quality assurance and control, research and development, technical consulting,\nmanagement, and sales and marketing. Graduates have an excellent background for post-graduate studies in\nscience, engineering, medicine, law, and business.\nProgram Educational Objectives and Student Outcomes\nEducational Objectives\nThe goal of the BS degree program in MSE is to provide the educational foundation that enables alumni to\npursue their personal career objectives. Historically, the majority of our alumni become valued members of\nindustrial and/or research teams within the field of materials science or related technical disciplines while a\nsmaller percentage pursue graduate education or other personal career objectives.\nThe specific objectives for the BS degree program in MSE are to produce alumni who are:\neffective communicators with written, oral, and visual media:\nable to apply critical thinking skills to engineering and research problems: and\neffective learners able to apply new technical tools, techniques, and knowledge specific to their field of\nemployment or graduate studies.\nStudent Outcomes\nUpon graduation, students completing the B.S. degree program in MSE will be able to:\nGeneral Outcomes\n(A) apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering\n(B) design and conduct experiments, as well as analyze and interpret data\n(C) design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as\neconomic, environmental, societal, global, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and\nsustainability\n(D) function on multidisciplinary teams while maintaining independent thought and expression(E) identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems\n(F) understand professional and ethical responsibility\n(G) communicate effectively\n(H) understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global economic, environmental, and societal context\n(I) recognize the need for, and to engage in, lifelong learning\n(J) apply knowledge of contemporary issues\n(K) use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice\nMaterials Specific Outcomes\n(L) apply advanced science (such as chemistry and physics) and engineering principles to materials\nsystems/problems\n(M) understand the scientific and engineering principles underlying the four major elements of the field:\nstructure, properties, processing, and performance\n(N) apply and integrate knowledge from each of the above four elements of the field to solve materials\nselection and design problems\n(O) utilize experimental, statistical, and computational methods consistent with the program educational\nobjectives.\nCurriculum\nStudents typically enter the MSE Department following completion of their first year studies within the College\nof Engineering, as administered by the Department of Engineering Education (EngE); a description of required\nfirst year coursework can be found within the EngE section of this catalog.\nIn addition to foundation courses in MSE, students tailor an individualized program of elective study. Fifteen\ncredits of technical electives will be selected to emphasize certain subdisciplines of MSE (e.g., metals,\nceramics, polymers, electronic materials, composites, biomaterials, nanomaterials, etc.) or to prepare for a\ncareer in certain application areas (e.g., manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, information technology,\nmicroelectronics, etc.). Course-work totals 131 credit hours as detailed on the BS in MSE checksheet which\ncan be found at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html. Students expecting to graduate\nbeyond the displayed checksheet years should use the last projected term until the checksheet for that\ncalendar year becomes available.\nThe undergraduate curriculum contains a nationally recognized integrated program of instruction in\nengineering communication including writing, public speaking, proposal preparation, reporting, research skills,\ncritical and creative thinking, and graphical presentation. More information regarding this unique program can\nbe found at http://www.mse.vt.edu/ecp.\nThe undergraduate program culminates with a two-semester team-oriented engineering design project in\nwhich the students address a significant problem in their area of special interest. MSE is unique within the\nCollege of Engineering in that they offer a more ambitious project for students enrolled in the University\nHonors program.\nThe MSE students have pursued various minors including Microelectronics, Green Engineering, Chemistry,\nMathematics, Music, a foreign language, and various others.\nThe B.S. in MSE degree program at Virginia Tech is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission\nof ABET, http://www.abet.org.\nEducational Enhancement Opportunities\nStudents of MSE can optionally participate in the cooperative education program in which qualified students\nmay alternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment.\n(www.career.vt.edu/experience/ceip.html)\nHonors-eligible students may participate in a formalized program of study leading to one of several university\nhonors degrees (see www.honorscollege.vt.edu). MSE traditionally graduates several students with thedegree \"Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering (in Honors)\", as well as some of the other\nHonors designations. Inquiries to MSE Advising are welcomed.\nThere are several department guided programs for study abroad and cultural exchanges. The MSE\ndepartment has established relationships with several universities offering strong MSE programs in other\ncountries. Programs in which the student studies abroad for one or two semesters typically have a foreign\nlanguage requirement. At this time, programs are available in China, France, Germany and Switzerland.\nStudents with interest in said programs are strongly advised to have at least two years of high school\nexperience with the appropriate language. Short-term (3 week) summer programs are available, which do not\nhave a language requirement.

Scholarship support is available. Please also refer to the School of\nPerforming Arts general information section for details.\nThe major in music, leading to a B.A., emphasizes four areas of music: music education; performance;\ntechnology and composition as well as a designed option. This designed option area is provided as a\nmeans for a student to tailor music and non-music courses into a curriculum that best meets the interests\nof the student. In addition to fulfilling the Curriculum for Liberal Education and the core curriculum\nrequirements of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, the music major must pursue a\nconcentration in one of the above areas of emphasis.\nThere are eight primary options available to music majors. These are:\n84-Credit Music Education Option (see website for details)\n51-Credit Performance - Liberal Arts Option\n78-Credit Performance - Professional Vocal Option\n78-Credit Performance - Professional Instrumental Option\n78-Credit Composition - Professional Option\n52-Credit Music Technology - Liberal Arts Option\n78-Credit Music Technology - Professional Option\nIn addition, all music majors must meet a minimum level of piano proficiency no later than two semesters\nprior to graduation. Music majors are expected to participate in an ensemble or as an accompanist every\nsemester of residence and attend a minimum number of concerts and recitals. Additional curriculum and\npolicy information is available in the Handbook for Music Majors on the department website.\nThere are three options available as a minor in music, including a general option, a music technology\noption and a jazz option. The minor in music consists of 18 semester hours selected from performance,\nhistory/literature, and theory/composition. Interested students should contact Tammy Henderson, Virginia\nTech, 246 Henderson Hall, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0240 or at tammyh@vt.edu for the exact\nrequirements.\nThe department follows the Curriculum for Liberal Education except in Area 4 - Scientific Reasoning and\nDiscovery, of which two credits of laboratory science are not required. Both the Department of Music and\nthe university foreign language requirement are the same, except for vocal performance majors.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet\nminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\")\nand toward the degree in music.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. in Music can be found on the major checksheet by\nvisiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (MUS)\n1004 (TA 1004): SCHOOL OF PERFORMING ARTS FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE\nOrientation to the School of Performing Arts philosophy and the resources of the School, the College, and\nthe University.

    "Nanoscience": "Overview\nBachelor of Science in Nanoscience\nSatisfactory Progress\nMinor in Nanoscience\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (NANO)\nDivision Leader: R. Heflin\nProgram Manager: C. Conley\nPrinciple Faculty: D. Capelluto, H. Dorn, S. Emori, A. Esker, C. Finkielstein, T. Grove, M.\nHochella, G. Khodaparast, G. Liu, T. Long, B. Magill, J. Matson, F. M. Michel, A. Morris, V.\nNguyen, K. Park, H. Robinson, and C. Tao\nWeb: www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/Nanoscience.html\nOverview\nThe Nanoscience (NANO) program is a joint effort of the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry,\nGeosciences, and Physics. It resides in, and is organized as a division of, the College of Science's\nAcademy of Integrated Science.\nNanoscience, the fundamental study of materials and structures whose size is on the nanometer scale,\nlies at the very foundation of our world. A nanometer is simply a billionth of a meter, and a typical atom is\nabout 1/10th of a nanometer in size. At this length scale, atoms and molecules follow the laws of\nquantum physics, and the processes of life (for example, DNA and proteins are naturally-occurring\nnanoscale materials) and the properties of materials emerge from them. Due to a combination of profound\ntheoretical insights, advances in scientific instrumentation, and massive computing power, we are now\ncapable of imaging and steering single atoms with unprecedented precision, opening a window toward a\nworld in which materials, chemical compounds, devices, and even small organisms can be built atom byatom and molecule by molecule, tailored toward desired properties and applications. At present, we are\nonly at the dawn of this nanoscience revolution.\nNanoscience courses prepare undergraduates for productive, exciting careers in emerging nanoscale\nindustries. Degree recipients from this program will be ready to contribute to and lead cutting-edge\ncorporate research and development in some of the most important and profitable industries in the world,\nincluding information technology, communications, drug development, imaging, and environmental\ntechnology.\nBachelor of Science in Nanoscience\nA special brochure describing the division and the B.S. program in Nanoscience is available from the\ndivision's webpage or upon request.\nDegree Requirements\nThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree\nrequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for\ngraduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours\nrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all\nrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.\nThe university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will\nnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a\ntransition plan for students already in the degree program.\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for degree requirements.\nSatisfactory Progress\nUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet\nminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education or Pathways to General\nEducation) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree.\nSatisfactory progress requirements toward the B.S. in Nanoscience can be found on the major\nchecksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html.\nMinor in Nanoscience\nPlease visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-\nbrief/index1.html for requirements toward a minor in Nanoscience.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (NANO)\n1015-1016: INTRODUCTION TO NANOSCIENCE\nIntroduction to the interdisciplinary field of nanoscience with perspectives from biology, geoscience,\ncomputational science, chemistry, and physics. 1015: Historical perspectives; public perception; economic\nimpact, nanoscience in biology and environment; quantum physics principles; characterization tools;\nmathematical modeling. 1016: Nanofabrication methods; nanoparticle synthesis and characterization; self-\nassembly; applications in medicine, electronics, and energy; sustainability.

In our research, teaching, and engagement, we\nseek to craft and apply new forms of critical inquiry that advance integrative intellectual thought. These paths\nof inquiry inform our engagement with students, who become well prepared to understand complextransformations throughout their lives, whether they pursue graduate studies or other life trajectories.\nThe department offers an undergraduate degree in Religion and Culture (RLCL), including a degree option in\nHumanities for Publoc Service, and minors in American Studies, Appalachian Studies, Asian Area Studies,\nJudaic Studies, Medieval and Early Modern Studies, Middle East Studies, Popular Culture, and Religion.\nThe department also offers an M.A. in Material Culture and Public Humanities, two graduate certificates--one\nin Religious Studies and the other in Material Culture and Public Humanities; and is a core member of the\nAlliance for Social, Political, Ethical, and Cultural Thought (ASPECT) Ph.D. program.\nReligion and Culture Major (RLCL)\nThe Bachelor of Arts degree in Religion and Culture (RLCL) combines the strengths of the department in the\nareas of the humanities and study of religion in order to provide students with opportunities to examine several\nof the twenty-first century's most important global phenomena.

Therefore it prepares them to sensitively and\nthoughtfully work for the public good.\nStudents who choose this major will develop complex problem-solving skills, alongside critical thinking that will\nprepare them for a wide range of careers. The global focus of the major affords career opportunities in\neducation, business, government, many private industries, and the non-profit sector.

Agozino and W. Reed\nGloria Smith Endowed Professor: K. Harrison (Africana Studies/Sociology)\nAssociate Professors: K. Harrison (Africana Studies/Sociology), P. Polanah, and P. Seniors\nAffiliated Faculty: R. Briggs (Political Science), N. Giovanni (English), B. Faulkner (Political Science), A.\nFew (Human Development), V. Fowler (English), C. Gitre (History), E. Graves (Sociology), M. Heaton\n(History), M. Herndon (Summer and Winter Programs), S. Johnson (Religion and Culture), R. Jones\n(Psychology), L. Roy (English), T. Sato (School of Education), B. Shadle (History), P. Wallenstein\n(History), and V. White (School of Visual Arts)\nAfricana Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that uses concepts and methodologies of the Social\nSciences and the Humanities, centering on the study of peoples of African descent. The program\ncooperates with faculty from across the university, whose teaching and research is concerned with Africa\nand the African diaspora. Africana Studies engages with other programs and organizations in community\nawareness activities that celebrate the richness and diversity of African diasporic cultures and traditions.\nAn Africana Studies minor is open to all students who are interested in learning about the experiences of\nAfricans and people of African descent.\nAmerican Indian Studies: A Holistic Approach\nDirector: Samuel R. Cook\nAssociate Professor: S. Cook\nAssistant Professor: N. Copeland\nA program in the Department of Sociology, we offer several courses and a minor in American Indian\nStudies.\nWe believe that any successful American Indian Studies program must do more than simply educate a\ngeneral student body on American Indian cultures and issues in a sensitive way. We believe that our\ncurricula must exist in conjunction with all university programs pertinent to American Indians, and must\ndepend on the impetus of indigenous peoples working within and beyond the university.\nIn keeping with Virginia Tech's status and mission as a land grant institution, we strive to serve our\nindigenous constituency, both as educators and as partners. Accordingly, our program serves as a vital\nconduit for university-tribal relations, the recruitment and retention of American Indian students and\nfaculty, and Service-Learning initiatives in indigenous communities. Although our program has a regional\nfocus, we offer a wide spectrum of courses--ranging from American Indian Literatures, American Indian\nSpirituality, and American Indian Arts, to native Peoples of the Southeast, American Indians in Film, and\nGlobal indigenous Rights--reflecting the impressive and diverse expertise of our faculty.\nIn short, we embrace a holistic, collaborative approach to American Indian Studies in which university\nfaculty and students develop and maintain meaningful partnerships. Accordingly, we maintain a tribaladvisory board consisting of elders and leaders from all of Virginia's eight Indian Nations. We regard\nthese representatives, and ultimately, all indigenous peoples as our colleagues.\nWomen's and Gender Studies Program\nDirector: Sharon P. Johnson\nProfessors: N. M.

The Women's and Gender Studies Program is housed in\nthe Department of Sociology and includes teaching faculty and affiliates from across the entire campus.\nWGS affiliated faculty contribute to the program through their research, student advising, participation in\ngovernance, and teaching. Women's and Gender Studies 1824 is a pathways course. Our program also\noffers courses for all students in the university, including four in Area 2 of the Curriculum for Liberal\nEducation (WGS 1824, WGS 2224, WGS 2244, and WGS 2254), one in Area 3 (WGS 2264), and one in\nArea 7 (WGS 3214). Students interested in WGS may select from two minors, Women's and Gender\nStudies, and Gender, Science, and Technology. The degree option and minors are interdisciplinary,\ncross-cultural programs of study in which students cultivate an understanding of the complex ways that\ngender is defined and contested in social structures, history, culture, and technology. They offer students\nnew ways of thinking about how gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality shape social institutions and\ncultural beliefs as well as personal experiences and perceptions. Central to the mission of the Women's\nand Gender Studies Program is the empowerment of a diverse population of women within local, regional,\nnational, and global contexts.\nStudents interested in learning more about the Women's & Gender Studies program should contact theprogram director, Sharon Johnson at spjohnso@vt.edu\nA graduate certificate in Women's and Gender Studies is also available. See the Graduate Catalog.\nCenter For Peace Studies and Violence Prevention\nDirector: James Hawdon\nThe Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention is a student-center, multi-disciplinary undertaking\nto promote research, education and outreach in the area of peace studies and violence prevention. Since\nits inception in 2008, the Center has adopted three thematic areas:\nThe prevention of violence\nPeace studies\nThe development of new leaders for this century\nThe Center is a hub for research and pedagogy on peace studies and violence prevention. Our\nmultidisciplinary approach allows students, faculty, and a variety of off-campus constituents to address\npeace building and violence prevention in a holistic manner.\nThe Center for Peace Studies offers a minor in Peace Studies. The minor is designed to provide students\nwith a broad perspective on violence prevention and peace building. Students minoring in Peace Studies\nwill be required to take two core courses, Peace and Violence as Critical Incidents (PSVP 2044) and\nGlobal Society, Violence and the Prospects for Peace (PSVP 4104). In addition, students will select four\nelective courses from a variety of courses that focus on either \"local\" issues of violence prevention and\npeace building or \"global\" issues of violence prevention and peace building.\nCenter for Race & Social Policy\nDirector: Wornie Reed\nThe Center for Race and Social Policy (RSP), presently a College Center, was formed in April 2001 as a\nUniversity Center to fulfill two primary goals: (1) to conduct and disseminate original research in the area\nof public policy with a direct emphasis on race and ethnicity; and (2) to prepare promising graduate\nstudents to think and speak critically, plan quality research, and contribute to public-policy discussions\nrelated to race and ethnicity.\nThe Center promotes a broad and inclusive concept of race and ethnicity, which includes African\nAmericans, American Indians, Asian Americans, European Americans, Latinos, and bi-racial and multi-\nracial identities. RSP research projects involve the development and evaluation of public policy across\ndifferent racial and ethnic contexts and within myriad public policy venues, including welfare,\nemployment, education, and health as well as community outreach.\nUndergraduate Course Descriptions (AFST)\n1714: INTRODUCTION TO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES\nIntroduction to the interdisciplinary field of African American Studies.
